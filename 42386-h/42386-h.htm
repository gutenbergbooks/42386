<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="dropleft">A</span>N attempt has been made in the following pages to give a general view of the principal
events in the reign of Queen Victoria and the changes resulting from the development
of the means of travel and communication, the accumulation of wealth, the acquirement
of political power by the people, and the spread of education among them. In
making this attempt the author had to choose between compiling a dry chronicle, and
placing before his readers the salient points in a period of rapid and successful progress. He chose
the latter; but, in order to carry his purpose into effect within the limits assigned to him, he had to
pass in silence over the names of many persons distinguished in politics, science, literature, art, and
warfare. Those, or the descendants of them, whose achievements entitle them to an honoured place in
the annals of their age, will understand that it was possible only to find room for mention of a few of
the illustrious band who have contributed to the great work of empire and civilisation.</p>

<p>Especially in regard to literature, it may be felt that the reference to that department is out of
all proportion to its importance. But the subject is so vast that it is almost hopeless to deal with, to
any good purpose, in two or three pages. Attention has, however, been drawn in the concluding
chapter to the effects of universal compulsory education on our national prosperity, moral character,
and intellectual life. In respect of its action on the material well-being of the population, it is not
unreasonable to attribute to its influence part of the marked decrease in pauperism in the last quarter
of a century, even if the more equable diffusion of wealth be reckoned the principal factor in that
process. If the results quoted cannot be proved to be the direct outcome of universal education, at
all events they synchronise in a remarkable manner with the period of its existence.</p>

<p>Turning next to the literary habits of the people, it is not possible to doubt the important
bearing which recreative reading has upon the national character. We are not, and probably never
shall be, a nation of students, but we have become within the limits of the present reign a nation of
readers. The press of the country is free&mdash;free in a sense that has never been tolerated in any other
State. Public men and measures are submitted to searching criticism in a degree that would be
wholly intolerable but for the general high tone maintained in British journalism. There are few
things more remarkable in our civilisation than the abundance of excellent writing supplied to the
daily and weekly press, and the sound morality which pervades it.</p>

<p>Next to the newspaper press, and hardly inferior to it in influence, is the mass of fiction produced
year after year in ever-increasing volume. To ascertain how vastly its attractions prevail over those of
historical, poetic, philosophic, or scientific works, it is only necessary to consult the returns of any free
library. For good or for ill, the thoughts of countless readers, old and young, are continually engaged
on the fictitious fortunes, dilemmas, and vicissitudes of imaginary individuals. On the whole, the
influence of this literature is harmless and in some degree salutary, though it is true that within
recent years a school of novelists has arisen, containing some skilful and attractive writers, who rely
on winning popularity by going as near as they dare to the worst kind of realism pursued by certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
French authors. It will do incalculable damage, not only to English literature, but to the English
character, if the public, in whose hands is the verdict, encourage perseverance in this line. Hitherto,
in the present century, fiction has been maintained in Great Britain at a higher level than it has ever
touched before. The most popular writers of romance&mdash;Scott, Marryat, Thackeray, Dickens (not to
mention any living authors)&mdash;dealt, indeed, with the foibles, crimes, and misfortunes of men and
women, but they never failed to keep a high ideal before their readers. Their favourite characters
were depicted as at war with evil: not always successful, not without frailty, and even folly; but no
religion ever preached a purer morality than did these masters in the story-teller&rsquo;s craft. It will be
deplorable if people learn to employ their leisure, not in narratives of heroism, self-denial, and innocent
love, but in studies of degradation and despair, and restless stirring of sexual problems.</p>

<p>Some of the most striking and valuable discoveries in physical science receive mention in the
course of this narrative, as being among the more memorable features of the reign, but it has been
impossible even to allude to countless others, almost as important to the welfare and progress of
humanity. Less obvious to the general public, but not less remarkable, has been the application of
the exact and comparative method to intellectual research, so that, although students still differ, and
are likely to continue to the end of time to differ on some of the conclusions at which they arrive, for
the first time in the world&rsquo;s history they are of one mind about the right system of enquiry.</p>

<p>There are still to be witnessed in the Queen&rsquo;s realm those violent contrasts between vast wealth
and grinding poverty, which must ever arise in every civilised State in periods of great commercial
and productive activity. They are a standing perplexity and distress to philanthropists; but one of the
brightest features in the reign of Queen Victoria, of infinitely deeper significance than the accumulation
of riches by the nation and by individuals, is the degree to which that wealth has penetrated the
middle and industrial classes.</p>

<p>The effect of the application of steam to machinery, which coincided so nearly with the beginning
of the present reign, was, indeed, injurious to certain limited industries, but the general result has
been a continuous rise in the wages paid to artisans. The first few years of the factory system,
coupled with a lamentable ignorance of, and indifference to, sanitary principles, brought a terrible
increase of disease, squalor, and suffering in their train. This soon attracted the attention of
philanthropists, among whom the leading place must be assigned to the Earl of Shaftesbury; and year
by year the two rival political parties have vied with each other in applying remedial and protective
legislation to the evils of overcrowding, insanitary dwellings, and other dangers besetting extraordinary
industrial activity. There are slums still, but they must be hunted for, instead of forcing themselves
on attention as was the case not long ago in almost every large town. Artisans&rsquo; dwellings, far
exceeding in comfort, in solidity, and in sanitation anything that our forefathers may have dreamt of,
are now the rule and not the exception.</p>

<p>Mere quotation of figures will not make clear the increased share of the national wealth which
now finds its way into the pockets of the working classes, because the unprecedented cheapness of all
the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life (intoxicants alone excepted) has raised the buying
power of wages in a degree which cannot be estimated. Mr. W. H. Mallock, a well-known writer on
this subject, has recently devoted some close enquiry to it, and has brought out some remarkable
results. He quotes the calculation of statisticians upon the income of the nation in 1851, when it
was estimated at £600,000,000, and in 1881, when it was reckoned at £1,200,000,000, having doubled
itself in thirty years. He then deducts from these totals the amounts assessed to income-tax, arriving
by this process at the total paid in wages (or the total of all incomes under £150), which was
£340,000,000 in 1851, and £660,000,000 in 1881. In those thirty years the wage-earning class had
increased in number from 26,000,000 to 30,000,000, or 16 per cent., while the wages paid to them
had increased by nearly 100 per cent. In fact the income of the working classes in 1881 was about
equal to that of the whole nation in 1851, with largely increased purchasing power, owing to
reduction in prices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>
But this does not exhaust the evidence of the diffusion of wealth which has been going on, a
process which is apt to be overlooked in the attention attracted to the building up of a few colossal
fortunes. Mr. Mallock shows, by taking the increase in the number of incomes between £150 and
£1,000 a year, how greatly the middle classes have increased in numbers. Persons assessed for
taxation on incomes between these limits have increased in number during the period under consideration
from 300,000 to 990,000, that is, in a ratio of nearly 250 per cent. It is hardly possible to
over-estimate the importance of these figures in their bearing on the prospects of the stability of the
present social system in Great Britain. Had this enormous increase in wealth been accumulated in a
few hands, it must have given a great impetus to the revolutionary agencies always present under
settled governments. But its dispersal among a multitude of owners broadens the foundations of
authority, and at the same time acts as a powerful check upon legislation for a limited class.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that, side by side with the advance in general welfare, certain less desirable
incidents of our civilisation claim attention. One of these is the recurrence of disputes on a large
scale between employers and workmen, resulting in industrial strikes far exceeding in extent and
intensity anything of the sort that could be organised before the legislature relaxed the laws against
conspiracy and combination. Although labour disputes are conducted now with a general absence of
the violence which almost invariably accompanied them in earlier days, they are not without deplorable
results in the losses entailed on the working classes during their continuance, and in the damaging
effect they sometimes bring upon the industries affected. But the principle of arbitration is gradually
winning its way, and the fact that on several recent occasions recourse to this reasonable method has
proved successful in averting a prolonged struggle, encourages the hope that employers and employed
are beginning to recognise their common advantage in conciliation.</p>

<p>It is less easy to prescribe a remedy for the admitted evil of the excessive aggregation of the
people in centres of industry, and the corresponding depletion of the rural districts. This tendency
has been at work ever since Virgil wrote his&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="indent2">&ldquo;O fortunatos nimium, sua si bona norint,</div>
<div class="line">Agricolas&rdquo;&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">and perhaps from long before. Increased facilities of locomotion, and the stimulus lent by education
to intellectual energy, have intensified the movement; but at all events the worst effects of it on the
national physique are being mitigated by the attention directed to sanitary engineering.</p>

<p>One of the results of general education has been to give greater breadth and accuracy to the
popular aspirations for the Empire. Five and twenty years ago the British Colonies were regarded,
even by experienced statesmen, with a degree of indifference, which it is difficult for the present
generation to realize. It seemed to be assumed that, sooner or later, each of them would throw off
the bond attaching it to the Mother country, and that nothing was to be gained by maintaining a
union of which the value could not be shown in a profit and loss account. A complete change has
come over public opinion in this respect. Imperial federation is in the air; the precise means by
which it is to be secured have not been formulated, but the sentiment is as strong in the general
mind of the natives of these islands as it seems to be in that of the Queen&rsquo;s subjects in India, in
Canada, and in Australasia. Although the presence of a large proportion of the Dutch race in our
South African Colonies renders the feeling in that land less pronounced, it is not unreasonable to hope
that even there just laws, wise administration, and the prestige of a mighty empire will prevail to
dispel suspicion and establish a lasting harmony.</p>

<p>The example of good government, which has been set forth at home during the present reign, is
one in which every Briton may take a just pride. Party politics are as vehement as ever, and
sometimes descend into acrimony; but the last traces of corruption have disappeared from public life,
and all the acts of administration are open to the most searching scrutiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
Not less remarkable is the change which has come over the habits of all classes in regard to
alcoholic indulgence, which, throughout the last century and a considerable portion of the present
one, remained as a reproach on our social life. Formerly, though intemperance was looked on as
undesirable, it was not thought discreditable, or, at least, not incompatible with the discharge of the
most important offices. But at the present time indulgence in drink is regarded as a bar to all except
ordinary manual labour, and even in that department the working man is steadily emancipating
himself from the thraldom which, at no distant date, lay so heavily upon all classes.</p>

<p>These, and many others such as these, are some of the features which distinguish the longest
reign in our annals. So important are they, regarded as affecting the happiness of millions of human
beings, that the remarkable length of the reign sinks into secondary moment compared with its
character. It has been an age of material progress more swift and political change more permanent
than any which preceded it, and there have not been wanting those who viewed each successive step
in the movement with apprehension, predicting disaster to cherished institutions&mdash;to the monarchy
itself. The result, so far, has been to falsify those predictions. The British monarchy reposes at
present on surer foundations than military prowess or legislative sagacity can supply; it rests on the
genuine affection of the people. Power has been committed to them during these sixty years in no
illiberal measure; in a very practical sense they are masters, under the Almighty, of the destiny of
the empire, for they can, by their votes, put those Ministers in power who shall do their pleasure.
How comes it that this power has been exercised with a moderation very different from that which
there is plenty of historical precedent for anticipating? There are doubtless many contributory causes&mdash;an
abundant employment owing to the expansion of industry, cheap food, the diffusion of wealth,
the readiness of the British people to avail themselves of new lands, the hold which religious principles
keep upon them, and the instinctive conservatism which affects, often unconsciously to themselves, all
but those who adopt extreme views in politics. All these, and many more, must be taken into account
in considering what has taken place; but there is one which a watchful observer will reckon more
direct in its effect than any of them&mdash;namely, the personal character of the Monarch. Vigilant as she
is known to have been in attention to public affairs, conscientious as she has shown herself in
complying with the limitations of our Constitution, Queen Victoria has set before her people a perfect
Court and a model home. Not by design has this been done, not by laborious compliance with
irksome rules or straining for public approval, but by the action of a true nature, guided by a vigorous
intellect and resolute will.</p>

<p>What might have been the result of the enormous development of popular power if the Monarch
had been one whose character had attracted no affection or respect, it is idle to speculate. It is
enough that every true Briton is able to say, with heartfelt gratitude: &ldquo;Thank Heaven that throughout
this critical period of change we have remained the subjects of Victoria the Great and Good!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="dropleft">A</span>T the present day, tidings, however fateful or momentous, flash silently over unconscious
fells and floods to the uttermost limits of Empire; but it was otherwise sixty years
ago. Throughout the brief night of June 19, 1837, the land echoed to the furious
galloping of horses and the ceaseless rattle of flying wheels; for William the King
lay dying at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>He drew his last breath before dawn on the 20th, and mounted messengers thronged the highways
yet more thickly than before in the early hours of morning.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Death of William IV.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Among them were two of very high
degree&mdash;Dr. Howley, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Marquis of Conyngham,
Lord Chamberlain&mdash;charged to proceed post haste to Kensington Palace in order
to summon the Princess Victoria to the throne of Great Britain and Ireland.
Leaving Windsor shortly after two in the morning, they did not reach Kensington till five o&rsquo;clock.
The Palace was wrapped in silence; it was with great difficulty that even the gate-porter could be
roused, and there was further delay inside the courtyard. At last the Archbishop and the Lord
Chamberlain obtained admission, were shown into a room, and left to themselves.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Princess Alexandrina Victoria summoned to Throne.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
After waiting some time they rang the bell, and desired the sleepy servant who
answered it to convey to the Princess their request for an immediate audience,
on business of extreme urgency. Again the impatient dignitaries were left alone,
and once more they pealed the bell. This time they were informed by the Princess&rsquo;s attendant that
Her Royal Highness was asleep, and must on no account be disturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are come,&rdquo; was their reply, &ldquo;on business of State to the Queen, and even <i>her</i> sleep must
give way to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The attendant yielded, and then, to quote the simple but vivid description by Miss Wynn, &ldquo;in
a few minutes she (the Queen) came into the room in a loose white nightgown and shawl, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
nightcap thrown off, and her hair falling on her shoulders, her feet in slippers, tears in her eyes,
but perfectly collected and dignified.&rdquo;</p>

Her extreme youth

a considerable assemblage at the palace,
notwithstanding the short notice that was
given.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Bowing to the lords present, Queen
Victoria, quite simply dressed in black, took
her seat, and proceeded to read her speech
in clear, calm accents. Then, having taken
the oath for the security of the Church of
Scotland, she received the allegiance of the Privy Councillors present, the two Royal Dukes having
precedence of the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As these two old men,&rdquo; wrote Greville,
&ldquo;her uncles, knelt before her ... I saw her
blush up to the eyes, as if she felt the contrast
between their civil and natural relations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At noon the Queen held a Council, at
which the excellent impression she had made
already was confirmed. Throughout the trying
ceremonies of the first day of her reign
she bore herself with a dignity and composure
which amazed, as much as it delighted, her
Ministers.</p>

<p>Princess Alexandrina Victoria, upon whose
young shoulders the weight of the Empire
had been laid so suddenly, was the only child
of Edward, Duke of Kent, fourth son of
George III., by her Serene Highness Victoria
Maria Louisa, daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld,
and widow of the Prince
of Leiningen. William IV., third son of
George III., had left no children born in wedlock;
on his death, therefore, the succession
devolved on his niece, who was born on
May 24, 1819, and was therefore just over
eighteen at her accession. Nothing would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
been more natural than that the character of the Princess, as heiress to the Crown, and the qualifications
for rule of which she might have given promise even at that tender age, should have been widely
and eagerly discussed, or, at least, that the late King&rsquo;s Ministers should have formed some opinion of
them; but this was not the case. The gossiping Greville repeatedly lays stress on the seclusion in
which Her Royal Highness had been brought up, her inexperience, and the complete ignorance of
the public about her character and even her appearance; so much so, that &ldquo;not one of her
acquaintance, none of the attendants at Kensington, not even the Duchess of Northumberland, her
governess, have any idea of what she is or promises to be.&rdquo; It may easily be imagined, therefore,
how greatly the severity of the sudden ordeal to which the girl-Queen was exposed was intensified
by the anxious and curious interest of those who were present at her first Council.</p>

Royalty.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Her early training.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Duke of Kent had died shortly after the birth of his daughter, and his widow,
over-anxious, perhaps, to screen the young life from contagion of evil, sought to
protect the Princess Victoria by a training which, in most modern families, would
be regarded as unnecessarily severe. But deep-rooted custom requires drastic treatment to remove
it. On weak or light natures such discipline is too often seen to work disastrous reaction; happily,
the young Queen was inspired by an intellect of such fibre, and a spirit of such temper, that she
responded to her early training by establishing and maintaining in her Court such a high moral
ideal as has never been known since the days of the mythical Round Table.</p>

AGE OF FOUR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Queen Victoria&rsquo;s accession was the cause of the departure from England of a Prince deservedly
unpopular, whose signature stands first among those appended to the Act of Allegiance executed at
Kensington Palace.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Severance of the Crown of Great Britain and Hanover.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Hitherto, for more than one hundred and twenty years, succession to the throne
of Great Britain had carried with it the crown of Hanover;
but, inasmuch as that crown was limited to the male line, it
passed, on the death of King William, to
his eldest surviving brother, the Duke of
Cumberland. It is not necessary to discuss
here the character of that Prince&mdash;it is
enough to say that his departure to take up his inheritance in
Hanover was probably cause of regret to very few persons in
this country and reason for rejoicing to a great many. Nor,
in looking back over the history of the past sixty years, can
any thoughtful person fail to recognise advantage in the severance
of the monarchies of Great Britain and Hanover. Any
loss of prestige or dignity which might have been anticipated
has been amply outweighed by the freedom enjoyed by this
country from continental complications. England, while she
has forfeited no weight in the Councils of Europe, is in a
far stronger position to enforce her will when necessary, and
the development of rapid and easy transit have protected
Englishmen from any disadvantage that might have been
apprehended from an exclusively insular Court.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN AS PRINCESS VICTORIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of the incidents of the ceremony of accession commented on with most interest was the fact
that, in signing the Oath for the security of the Church of Scotland, the Queen wrote only &ldquo;Victoria,&rdquo;
instead of her full name &ldquo;Alexandrina Victoria.&rdquo;
Surely it was a happy inspiration which prompted
the choice of the single name&mdash;prophetic, as it has
turned out, of the character of the coming reign.
Probably not one in a thousand of her subjects
are aware that Her Majesty has two baptismal
names, though there is historic interest attached
to their origin. The Duke of Kent gave his
daughter the name of Alexandrina in compliment
to the Empress of Russia, intending her second
name should be Georgiana. The Regent, however,
objected to the name Georgiana being second to
any other in this country; so, as the Princess&rsquo;s
father was determined that Alexandrina should be
the first name, it was decided she should not bear
the other one at all.</p>

<p>On July 17 the Queen went in State to the
House of Lords to prorogue Parliament.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Prorogation of Parliament.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
After listening to an Address made
by the Speaker on behalf of
the House of Commons, and
giving her consent to certain bills, Her Majesty
proceeded to read her speech to Parliament in clear
and unfaltering accents. The concluding paragraph,
viewed in the light of subsequent events, must be
admitted to have been more amply fulfilled than
most human promises, however sincerely spoken:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ascend the throne with a deep sense of

supported by the consciousness of my own
right intentions, and by my dependence on the
protection of Almighty God. It will be my

improvement is required, and to do all in my
power to compose and allay animosity and
discord. Acting upon these principles, I shall,

<p>&ldquo;All that I hear of the young Queen leads to the conclusion that she will some day play a
conspicuous part, and that she has a great deal of character.... Melbourne thinks highly of her
sense, discretion, and good feeling; but what seems to distinguish her above everything are caution
and prudence, the former in a degree which is almost unnatural in one so young, and unpleasing
because it suppresses the youthful impulses which are so graceful and attractive.... With all her
prudence and discretion she has great
animal spirits, and enters into the magnificent
novelties of her position with the
zest and curiosity of a child.... The
smallness of her stature is quite forgotten
in the majesty and gracefulness of her
demeanour.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Sixty years ago! It is the second
and third generation from that time which
now cries &ldquo;God save the Queen! Long
live Victoria!&rdquo; Never before in the
history of our nation has it fallen to the
lot of any historian to tell the story of
such a long reign, to chronicle such
unbroken national progress, to trace such
a series of peaceful changes, to record
such accumulation of wealth and diffusion
of comfort in a like period.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago! The population of
these islands was then some twenty-five
millions; it amounts now to upwards of
thirty-eight millions.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Early Railways.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Liverpool and Manchester Rail&shy;way,
about thirty miles
long, had been open for eight years,
causing far-sighted folk to predict an
important change in the mode of travelling.
The Liverpool and Birmingham
Railway was opened in the year of the
Queen&rsquo;s accession. In 1838 the line
between London and Birmingham was
finished, and trains were timed to do the
distance&mdash;112¼ miles&mdash;at the average
speed of twenty miles an hour. The
London and Croydon Railway began
running in 1839, and in 1840 there were 838 miles of railway open in the United Kingdom. At the
present time there are 20,000 miles open, owned by companies which in 1894 had an authorised
capital of £1,099,013,785, earning a gross revenue of £84,310,831, and a net profit of £37,102,518.</p>

<div class="caption"> STEPHENSON&rsquo;S LOCOMOTIVE, &ldquo;THE ROCKET.&rdquo;

<p>This engine was constructed by Messrs. Stephenson &amp; Co. in 1829, to compete
in the trial of locomotive engines held at Rainhill, on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway in October of that year, where it gained the prize of £500. The
&ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; worked on the Liverpool and Manchester line till 1837, when it was
removed to the Midgeholm Railway, near Carlisle. It ceased running in 1843&ndash;4,
and was presented to the South Kensington Museum in 1862.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In order to convey the impressions of an educated traveller by the new mode of transit, the
temptation to quote once more from the lively Greville is irresistible. In July 1837 he became tired
of hearing nothing in London except about the Queen and the coming elections, so he resolved to see
the new Birmingham and Liverpool Railway. Reaching Birmingham in 12½ hours by coach, he &ldquo;got
upon the railroad at half-past seven in the morning. Nothing can be more comfortable than the
vehicle in which I was put, a sort of chariot with two places, and there is nothing disagreeable about
it but the occasional whiffs of stinking air which it is impossible to exclude altogether. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
sensation is a slight degree of nervousness and a
feeling of being run away with, but a sense
of security soon supervenes, and the velocity is
delightful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;velocity&rdquo; referred to was regulated to
an average of about twenty miles an hour; but
the diarist makes mention of a foolhardy driver
who ventured to run forty miles an hour, and
was promptly dismissed by the directors.</p>

largest coupled driving wheels hitherto known, viz., 7 ft. 7 in. The diameter of the cylinders inside is 20 in. A sister engine (No. 1869) was
constructed at the same time, and the weight of each of them with tender fully loaded is over 90 tons.</p>

<p>The application of another of the forces of
Nature to the service of human intercourse has
brought about a change in political, military, social,
and commercial relations even
more complete than that
wrought by steam.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Electric Telegraph.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The invention of the electric
telegraph coincided very nearly with the beginning
of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s reign. In 1835 Mr. Morse, an
American citizen, produced a working
model of an instrument designed to
communicate alphabetical symbols by
the interruption of the electric current,
but he failed to persuade Congress to
furnish him with the funds necessary to
the practical application of his discovery.
Next year he tried to take out a patent
for it in this country; but, meanwhile,
Cooke and Wheatstone had anticipated
him with one instrument, and the brothers
Highton with another, both of which were
soon in use on railways. The growth of
this means of communication may be seen
in the &ldquo;Post Office Annual,&rdquo; which shows
that in the year 1895&ndash;96 about seventy-nine
million telegrams were delivered
through the Post Office, besides those
dealt with by certain public companies.</p>

<p>Two personages in the procession, who had met
under far different circumstances in earlier years, met
with a tremendous ovation wherever they moved. One
of these was the Duke of Wellington&mdash;our Great Duke&mdash;and
the other was the veteran Duke of Dalmatia&mdash;the
puissant Maréchal Soult of the Peninsula and
Waterloo&mdash;once the redoubtable foe of England.
Mr. Justin McCarthy has suggested that &ldquo;the cheers
of a London crowd on the day of the Queen&rsquo;s coronation did something genuine and substantial
to restore the good feeling between this country and France, and efface the bitter memories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Waterloo.&rdquo; On the other hand, the anti-monarchical party in France attributed the popular
reception of Soult in London to the prevalence of sympathy with Republican
views.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Popular Reception of Wellington and Soult.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Certain it is that when, in later years, Soult championed the English
alliance in the French Assembly he referred
with feeling to his reception at Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
coronation: &ldquo;I fought the English,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;down to Toulouse,
when I fired the last shot in defence of national independence;
in the meantime I have been in London, and France knows
how I was received. The English themselves cried &lsquo;Vive Soult!&rsquo;
They cried &lsquo;Soult for ever!&rsquo;&rdquo; One may formulate rules of
diplomacy and international courtesy, but who shall weigh the
effect of sympathy between a generous people and a former
gallant foe?</p>

<p>Parliament had voted £243,000 for the expenses of George IV.&rsquo;s
coronation&mdash;perhaps the effect of a newly-extended franchise may
be traced in the more economical figure of £70,000, which sufficed
for that of our present Queen.</p>

the Duke of Wellington. In 1830 he reconstructed

<p>The battle of Reform had been fought out in the country
and in Parliament five years before the accession, and there were,
as yet, no signs&mdash;to quote Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s famous expression at
Tamworth&mdash;of the Constitution being &ldquo;trampled under the hoof
of a ruthless democracy.&rdquo; On the whole, life&mdash;its business and
pleasures&mdash;seemed to be going forward on much the same lines
as before the great Act, dreaded, as it had been, as intensely by
one party, as it had been pressed forward and welcomed by the other. Lord Melbourne was the
head of a Whig Administration, of which, as everybody knows, the late King had waited impatiently
for the first decent opportunity to get rid. But Melbourne and Lord John Russell (who, with the

Melbourne and
Russell desired to put down Radicalism and
proceed with moderate and safe reforms,
above all in Ireland, where the chronic discontent was being
fanned to eruption by the exertions of Daniel O&rsquo;Connell. The
King&rsquo;s death had relieved the Whig Cabinet from the adverse
influence of the Court; moreover, the reliance placed from the
first by the young Queen upon Lord Melbourne, and the intimate
relations between them, brought about by the circumstances of
the case, enabled the Whigs to assume the peculiar rôle of their
opponents&mdash;that of the special supporters of the throne.</p>

<p>The Tories,<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> on the other hand, approached with much
misgiving the General Election, which, according to the law as
it then stood, followed of necessity on the demise of the
monarch. They knew that the Duchess of Kent had favoured
Whig principles in the education of the Queen; they saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Melbourne&rsquo;s personal charm had secured for him complete ascendancy in the councils of the new
Sovereign, and they had nothing to expect in the country but reverse.</p>

<p>However, the unpopularity of the new Poor Law told against Ministers in the rural constituencies,
and the elections left parties almost unchanged.

When the first Parliament of Queen Victoria
assembled on November 20, 1837, the Whig Government reckoned a majority of
about thirty in the House of Commons. &ldquo;Of power,&rdquo; wrote the contemporary
compiler of the <i>Annual Register</i>, &ldquo;in a political sense, they had none. They could
carry no measure of any kind but by the sufferance of Sir Robert Peel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One incident in the short winter session of 1837, often as
it has been recorded, retains a lasting interest because of the
subsequent celebrity of the individual who gave rise to it.
Mr. Benjamin Disraeli, the son of a distinguished man of letters,
had just entered Parliament for the first time as Member for
Maidstone. He chose a debate on Irish Election Petitions as
the opportunity for his maiden speech. &ldquo;A bottle-green frock
coat,&rdquo; writes an eye-witness, &ldquo;and a waistcoat of white, of the
Dick Swiveller pattern, the front of which exhibited a network of
glittering chains; large, fancy pattern pantaloons, and a black tie,
above which no shirt-collar was visible, completed the outward
man. A countenance lividly pale, set out by a pair of intensely
black eyes, and a broad but not very high forehead, overhung
by clustering ringlets of coal-black hair, which, combed away
from the right temple, fell in bunches of well-oiled ringlets over
his left cheek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a prepossessing personality in the eyes of the British
House of Commons, and when the young orator proceeded to
launch into profuse and
florid metaphor, accompanied
by exaggerated
theatrical gestures, the
forbearance usually shown
towards a new member&rsquo;s
first appearance was overborne
by impatience at
Disraeli&rsquo;s ludicrous affectation.
He spoke amid
incessant interruption and
laughter. &ldquo;At last, losing
his temper, which until
now he had preserved in
a wonderful manner, he
paused in the midst of a
sentence, and looking the Liberals indignantly in the face, raised his hands, and opening his mouth
as widely as its dimensions would admit, said in a remarkably loud and almost terrific tone, &lsquo;I have
begun several times many things, and I have often succeeded at last; ay, sir, and though I sit down
now, the time will come when you will hear me.&rsquo;&rdquo; The contrast between the early manner of this
statesman, and his peculiarly quiet and leisurely bearing in the debates of later years, betrays the close
study which he devoted to outward effect.</p>

The Prime Minister, William Lamb, second Viscount Melbourne, was a typical Whig, genuinely
disposed to moderate reform, but in the habit of meeting Radical suggestions with the discouraging
question, &ldquo;Why not leave it alone?&rdquo; Of similar
political temperament was his lieutenant in the
Commons, Lord John Russell. It very soon became
evident that the Radicals, though diminished in
numbers by the result of the elections, were likely
to give Ministers trouble in the new Parliament.
In the Upper Chamber, Lord Brougham, who had
conceived a violent dislike to Melbourne, began to
employ his fiery energy and power of acrid invective
against the Government, and showed himself ready
to place himself at the head of the Radicals. In
his first serious attack on Ministers he allied himself
with the Tory Lord Lyndhurst. The opportunity
arose out of events in Canada, to which it is necessary
briefly to refer.</p>

Reports of Fame, and Peace burning the Implements of War. <i>The Back Panel</i>:&mdash;Neptune and Amphitrite issuing from their palace in a triumphant car,
drawn by sea-horses, attended by the Winds, Rivers, Tritons, and Naiads, bringing the tribute of the world to the British shore. <i>Upper part of Back

Mercury supporting the Imperial Crown of Great Britain, and on each side the Liberal Arts and Sciences protected. The design of the Coach itself is in
keeping with the above ideas. The length of the Carriage is 24 feet; width, 8 feet 3 inches; height, 12 feet; length of pole, 12 feet 4 inches; weight, 4 tons.
The harness is made of red morocco leather. On State occasions eight cream-coloured horses, as here represented, are used.</p>

<p>By the Constitution of 1791 Canada had been
divided into two Provinces, Upper and Lower
Canada, each with its separate Governor, Executive
Council (corresponding to a Privy Council), Legislative
Council, appointed by the Crown for life,
and Representative Assembly. The bulk of the
people of Lower Canada were of French descent, Catholics, and intensely conservative of the
mode of life and habits of France before the Revolution.
English law had been established there by proclamation
in 1763, but by the wise Act of 1774 French civil law
was restored, and free exercise of the Roman Catholic
religion guaranteed. Probably all would have gone tranquilly
with the Province had its French population been
left to themselves. But they had restless neighbours
in Upper Canada. Englishmen, and especially Scots and
Ulstermen, had settled there in large numbers, busy, pushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
men of business, traders, and farmers, developing their land with energy, overflowing, as their children
multiplied, into the territory of their French fellow-subjects, and there forming a British party,
impatient of the antique legal procedure, the foreign law of land tenure, and the sleepy, unbusiness-like
ways of the Lower Province. Hence arose friction which soon
became chronic.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Rebellion in Canada.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Legislative Council, nominees of the Crown,
naturally favoured the British section, thereby
finding themselves at issue with the Representative
Assembly. Discontent had been smouldering for many years,
and at last matters came to a crisis. The Representative Assembly
resolved to resist further encroachment. Headed by Louis Papineau,
a militia officer and Member for Montreal, they drew up a protest
and laid their grievances
before the Governor, Lord
Gosford. They complained
of arbitrary infringement of
the Constitution and other
matters, demanded that the
Legislative Council should
be made elective, and ended
by refusing to vote supplies.
Public meetings were held,
and addressed in inflammatory
language by Papineau,
who dwelt on the example
set by the United States
in resisting tyranny. Lord
Gosford met matters with a
high hand. Warrants were
issued for the arrest of
certain representatives; resistance to their execution resulted
in violence, and the transition to rebellion was as speedy as
probably it was involuntary. <i>Proximus ardet</i>&mdash;the flame spread to Upper Canada, of which the
people had grievances of their own, though of a different kind from those of their French neighbours,
and a rising took place under the leadership of one McKenzie, a revolutionary journalist. But the
chief danger arose from the sympathetic action of certain American citizens, who, to the number
of several hundreds, assembled under a person named Van Rensselaer, and took possession of Navy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Island in the Niagara River, forming part of Canadian territory. At the present day, with the
dense population of the United States and rapid means of transit, such a position of affairs would
undoubtedly prove extremely critical; happily the British authorities proved able to deal with it
successfully. The rebels being ill-prepared for impromptu war, Lord Gosford put down the rising
in Lower Canada, though not without
considerable bloodshed. In Upper Canada,
the Governor, Major Head, better known
afterwards as Sir Francis Head, an
amusing writer, sent every regular soldier
at his command to the assistance of
Lord Gosford, and, declaring he would
rely on the loyal Canadians to suppress
the rebellion, handed over 6,000 stand
of arms to the Mayor of Toronto. The
people responded gallantly, delighted by
this mark of confidence; ten or twelve
thousand men assembled under arms,
and a single encounter with McKenzie&rsquo;s force was enough to decide the fate of the revolt. Desultory
skirmishing took place with bodies of American &ldquo;sympathisers&rdquo; at various points along the frontier
before the affair could be said to be over, and there can be no doubt that, had the United States
Government adopted a less friendly attitude, British rule in Canada might have stood in very
great jeopardy.</p>

<div class="caption">OLD GREAT WESTERN PASSENGER CARRIAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>The Imperial Parliament was summoned to meet on January 16, 1838, to consider the Canadian
situation. A Bill was introduced suspending the Constitution of Lower Canada, and empowering the
Queen to appoint a Governor and Special Council, who should assume for the time all the functions
of the legislature in that Province. The Duke of Wellington, as leader of the Opposition in the
Lords, and Sir Robert Peel in the Commons, supported the Government, and the only opposition was
offered by the Radicals. Brougham attacked the Bill in a speech of which Melbourne complained
as &ldquo;a most laboured and extreme concentration of bitterness.&rdquo; In the other House the chief
point of interest to readers of the debate at this day lies in a speech by Mr. W. E. Gladstone, the
Tory Member for Newark, who taunted Mr. Joseph Hume and the Radicals with their failure to
perform in session their boastful promises during the recess.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The Governor appointed under the Act was the Earl of Durham, a man of remarkable ability,
who had embraced Radical principles with great ardour.
This, however, did not prevent him
interpreting his office as that
of a practical dictator&mdash;he far
exceeded the powers
vested in him by the
Act.<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Earl of Durham.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In dealing with
offenders he would not stoop to
the only way of obtaining convictions&mdash;that
of packing juries&mdash;and
adopted the arbitrary course
of ordering into exile those connected
with the late rebellion, on
pain of death if they returned.
Looking back to the existing
state of things, it is impossible
to question the real clemency
and wisdom of the new Governor&rsquo;s
ordinances; nevertheless, they were at once attacked in the Imperial Parliament, and vigorously
denounced as tyrannical and unconstitutional. Lord Durham had made many enemies in both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Houses. Lord Lyndhurst and the Tories joined forces with Lord Brougham and the Radicals in
pressing Ministers to disallow the ordinances of which they had already approved. Brougham perceived
the opportunity of discomfiting the hated Melbourne, and he pressed
it. The Ministry were not strong enough to resist. Lord Durham
was recalled, and, though his recommendations were ultimately carried
into effect by making Canada a self-governing colony, he never
recovered the unmerited disgrace he had suffered. Proud, impetuous,
and sensitive, he fell into ill-health, and died in 1840 at the age of
forty-eight. His end must ever be regarded as one of those misfortunes
arising out of Party government, for his policy has been
amply vindicated since, lying as it does at the foundation of the whole
modern scheme of Colonial government.</p>

<p>Lord Brougham in 1837 had opposed the Government
measures relating to Canada. For some time he stood
alone, and it was not until the Bill for Abolishing the
Canadian Legislature had made considerable progress, that he
found himself supported by the Earl of Mansfield and Lord
Ellenborough. But though acting together on this occasion,
each had his own separate motive and argument, and perhaps
there were not three members of the House of Peers who better
deserved to be acting singly and without party connection.
Lord Brougham is here represented with the Earl of Mansfield
on his right arm and Lord Ellenborough on his left.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>One other debate in the Commons during this session must be
referred to, if it be only to mark the wide interval which separates
the Liberal Party of the present day from the Whig leaders at the
beginning of the reign. On February 15 Mr.
Grote brought forward his annual motion in
favour of the Ballot in Parliamentary elections.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Debate on Vote by Ballot.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Hitherto little interest had been attached to the project, owing to
the disfavour with which it was regarded by all but extreme Radicals.
On this occasion, however, several Ministers and many supporters of
the Government were known to have pledged themselves at the polls
to the principle of secret voting. Lord John Russell had declared
that to carry such a measure would be tantamount to a repeal of
the Reform Act of 1832; that
for the Government to promote
it would be a breach of faith to those who had supported
the extension of the franchise, and he refused to be any
party to &ldquo;what neither his sense of prudence nor of honour
would justify.&rdquo; Sir Robert Peel supported the Government in
resisting the motion, and it was rejected by a majority of
117 in a House of 513 Members. This was hailed as a moral
victory by the supporters of the Ballot. Brougham was
jubilant, and told the Lords they must make up their minds
to this fresh reform. A few days later he declared in Greville&rsquo;s
room that it would become law in five years from that time,
and many people regarded it as paving the way to Republican
government. On the other hand Greville quotes Charles
Villiers, &ldquo;one of the Radicals with whom I sometimes converse,&rdquo;
as declaring that it would prove a Conservative measure,
and that better men would be chosen. In effect, it took, not
five years, but thirty-four, to reconcile Englishmen to the
practice of secret voting; and Mr. Villiers has lived to see
that the protection thereby afforded to the voter has certainly
not operated to the exclusion of Conservatives from office.
But it would be unphilosophic to argue that what was conceded
in 1872 to an experienced and educated electorate,
without evil consequences, might have been bestowed with
equal safety in 1838, only five years after the great measure
of enfranchisement.</p>

perhaps, that the exclusive confidence reposed by Her Majesty in Lord Melbourne
should excite the jealousy of others, whose exalted rank gave them what they considered
a superior claim to access to the presence.</p>

<p>Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s constant attendance at Court had compelled him to change his demeanour
in a very remarkable degree.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s services and character.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Hitherto, his affectation had been to conceal all traces of seriousness
in transacting business; he would sprawl on a sofa, blow a feather about the room, balance a
chair, or dandle a cushion while receiving deputations&mdash;the very incarnation of
indolence&mdash;to the despair of those who anxiously desired to engage his attention,
and who could scarcely be persuaded by those who knew him best that he had
spent strenuous hours in getting up the subject under discussion, was perfectly acquainted with all
its details, and was, besides, listening most attentively to all that was said. His physician, Dr.
Copeland, knew how really hard the Prime Minister worked, and told Bishop Wilberforce that he
(Melbourne) used to transact business all day in his bedroom with his secretaries in order that bores
might be dismissed with the information that &ldquo;my lord had not yet left his bedroom.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="caption">THE THRONE ROOM AT WINDSOR CASTLE.</div>
</div>

<p>But besides this tiresome frivolity of manner, there was another habit in regard to which Melbourne
had to put severe restraint on himself in the Royal presence. It had been his custom to season his
conversation with a multitude of indecorous
oaths. Mr. Denison (afterwards
Speaker, and subsequently Viscount
Ossington) spoke to him one day about
some points in the Poor Law Bill, then
under consideration. Melbourne was
just going out for a ride, and referred
Denison to his brother George. &ldquo;I have
been with him,&rdquo; replied Denison, &ldquo;but
he damned me, and damned the Bill,
and damned the paupers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, damn
it! what more could he do?&rdquo; quoth
Melbourne, and rode off.</p>

<p>In spite of all his affectation and
a degree of underlying weakness, this
Minister performed a singularly valuable
public service to his country in the support
and advice he afforded the Queen
at the most critical time of her life; a
service that was explicitly and handsomely
acknowledged in the House of
Lords by his chief opponent there, the Duke of Wellington, in 1841.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of brooding discontent in the country at the opening of Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s reign, which soon passed into a phase calling for active measures of repression. Some
have recognised in the Chartist movement the chagrin of the working classes, who having imparted
to the mills of State the impetus necessary to grind
out political rights for their employers&mdash;the merchants,
farmers, and middle class generally&mdash;found
themselves no better
equipped for political action than
they were before.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Prevailing discontent of the Working Classes.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But such a
suggestion finds no reflection in actual experience
of popular movements. Agitators might declaim in
vain against the injustice of a restricted franchise if
their hearers had no other cause for discontent.
The real root of bitterness lay in the suffering and
distress caused by the severe winter of 1837&ndash;8, the
high price of bread,<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C"></a><a href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> and, on the top of all, detestation

It is genuine grievances
such as these which, from time to time, force on the
attention of those who suffer from them the glaring
contrast between the privations of
the many and the superfluities
of the few. So, in 1838, hungry crowds were easily
persuaded to listen to denunciations of the privileged
classes; to believe that the Queen and a dilettante

reform, a document was drawn up at a conference between a few Radical
members of Parliament and the representatives of the Working Men&rsquo;s
Association, formulating the demands made on behalf of the proletariate.
Universal male suffrage, annual Parliaments, vote by ballot, abolition of
the property qualification required at that time from a member of Parliament,
payment of members, and equal electoral districts, were the six
points insisted on; of which three, it will be seen,
have since been practically carried into effect.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Chartists.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
&ldquo;There
is your Charter!&rdquo; exclaimed O&rsquo;Connell, handing it to the secretary of
the Working Men&rsquo;s Association; &ldquo;agitate for it, and never be content
with anything less.&rdquo; The term took the popular fancy; the programme became known as the
Charter, and those who supported it were hereafter known as Chartists.</p>

<p>Not a very formidable programme after all, nor one that might not be advanced by constitutional
means, but one that, like many other popular agitations, fell into dangerous paths by the imprudent
zeal of some of its advocates, and still more, by the violence of the discontented, unfortunate, or
predatory waifs of civilisation, ever ready
to promote any social change for the
sake of what plunder it may bring
within their reach.</p>

<p>The Peninsula of Aden was added to Her Majesty&rsquo;s dominions by conquest in 1839. Its
situation at the mouth of the Red Sea, on the direct route to India and the East, makes it
invaluable as a coaling-station both for naval and mercantile purposes. In this district rain
falls only about once in three years. The town is supplied with wells and storage tanks
cut in the solid rock, the construction of which cost over £1,000,000.</p>

<p>In November 1839 the miners of
the Newport district of Monmouthshire
assembled to the number of 10,000
under a tradesman called Frost and
attempted to release from gaol one
Vincent, who had been imprisoned for
using seditious language.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Riots at Newport and elsewhere.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The mayor and
magistrates of Newport,
with a handful
of soldiers, offered a
gallant resistance; the rioters were dispersed
with a loss of ten killed and
fifty wounded, the mayor, Mr. Phillips,
receiving two gunshot wounds. Frost
and two others were afterwards convicted
of high treason and sentenced to death. But the dawn of milder methods of government had begun:
the death sentence was commuted by the Royal mercy to one of transportation for life: even that
was subsequently relaxed, and Frost was allowed to return to England some years later to find
himself and the Chartists an unquiet memory of the past.</p>

<p>But in spite of the punishment of the Newport rioters, and hundreds of others in different places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Chartism continued to spread until it became merged in the more intelligent and fruitful agitation
for the repeal of the Corn Laws.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">&ldquo;WILLIAM FAWCETT,&rdquo; THE FIRST P. &amp; O. STEAMSHIP, IN THE GUT
OF GIBRALTAR, 1837.</p>

<p>This was the first steamer employed in carrying mails to the Peninsular ports in 1837.
Tonnage, 206; horse-power, 60.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>This great question was brought under the consideration of Parliament, in the session of 1839,
by Lord Brougham in the Lords on
February 18, and the following day by
Mr. Charles Villiers in the Commons;
but the motion for inquiry was negatived
without a division in the former
and by a majority of 189 in the latter.
Both Parliament and country, however,
were to hear plenty about the Corn
Duties in the next few years.</p>

<p>The Whig Ministry were now approaching
the end of their second year
of office, and steadily losing favour in the
country. They had earned the enmity
of the Chartists by their apathy to further
reform; and the novel advantage of
Royal confidence in and affection for a
Whig Prime Minister did not affect the
general drift of middle-class opinion.
Meanwhile, Peel was indefatigable on the platform securing popular support for the new
Conservatism.</p>

<p>Drifting thus helplessly in the doldrums of unpopularity the Government suddenly foundered on
April 9, the immediate cause being a Bill for the suspension of the Constitution of Jamaica.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Fall of the Ministry.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The second reading was carried, indeed, by a majority of five; but the resignation
of the Ministry was immediately placed in Her Majesty&rsquo;s hands and accepted.
It put an end to an intolerable situation. Three days before the division Greville wrote in his
diary: &ldquo;The Government is at its last gasp: the result of the debate next week may possibly
prolong its existence,
as a cordial
does that of a
dying man, but
it cannot go on.
They are disunited,
dissatisfied,
and disgusted in
the Cabinet.&rdquo;</p>

difficulty, known as &ldquo;The Bedchamber

<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The &ldquo;Bedchamber Question.&rdquo;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Peel found no difficulty in filling
up the important posts in
the Government, until it
was explained to him that
the Court Offices were vacated with the Administrative
ones, and that they also must be
supplied. He took up a Red Book, as he
afterwards explained in Parliament, learnt from
it for the first time what were the different
appointments, and submitted to the Queen a
list of names to replace all except those below
the rank of Lady of the Bedchamber. But
Her Majesty had other views, and the reader
will more readily understand her reluctance to
part with those personal attendants, of whom she had grown fond, by remembering the singular
isolation of her youth, and the very few acquaintances she possessed at the beginning of her reign.</p>

<p>A difficulty of such slender proportions seems one that might have been got round, but it was
not to be. The Queen was inflexible, and Peel, on principle, resigned his office.

Lord Melbourne
and his colleagues were recalled; explanations followed in both Houses, and the

Peel was relieved from a position
the reverse of enviable, and Melbourne had to stand the brunt of a tirade from
the relentless Brougham and resume the reins which he had allowed to slip from a somewhat
reluctant hand.</p>

<p>As for the cause of dispute, it was not finally disposed of till after the Queen&rsquo;s marriage, when, on

<p class="alone in0 center">Originator of the system of uniform Penny Postage with
prepayment by stamps.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It sometimes happens that Ministries
which are least conspicuous by
the brilliancy of their career or the
talents of those who compose them,
nevertheless confer the most lasting
benefits on the nation. The crowning
achievement of the Melbourne administration
originated neither with a
Minister, nor with one of those permanent
officials upon whom Ministers
rely to make up for their own inexperience
of departmental work, but
with a humble school teacher. Nobody at this day connects penny postage with the name of
Mr. Spring Rice, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who paved the way for it in the Budget of 1839,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
but it is inseparably associated with the memory of its inventor, Sir Rowland Hill. The son of
a schoolmaster, Rowland had an extraordinary inborn love for arithmetic, and became mathematical
master in his father&rsquo;s school.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Penny Post.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This natural talent, it is said,
was directed to the study of Post Office statistics by an anecdote
told of Coleridge, who happened to see
a poor woman in the Lake district refuse to
accept delivery of a letter from a postman because she could
not afford to pay the postage&mdash;one shilling. Coleridge, hearing
that the letter was from her brother, good-naturedly insisted on
paying the fee, notwithstanding the woman&rsquo;s reluctance; but
no sooner was the postman&rsquo;s back turned than she showed him
that the letter consisted of nothing but a blank sheet. It had
been agreed between her and her brother that he should send
her such a blank sheet once a quarter so long as things went
well with him, marking the cover so that she should not require
to accept delivery, and that in this way she should get his mute
message without need to pay postage. Hill detected the economic
fallacy which opened the way to such innocent roguery,
and rested not till he had devised means to remedy it. He
published his design in pamphlet form in 1837, advancing the
bold proposition that the smaller the fee charged for carrying
letters the greater would be the multiplication of correspondence,
and the larger the profit to the Department. He proposed an uniform charge upon letters of one penny
a half ounce, irrespective of distance. It was the application to the public service of a commercial
principle by which large fortunes have been repeatedly realised in private business, but the plan was
unhesitatingly condemned by the Post Office authorities. The Postmaster-General, Lord Lichfield,
spoke of it in the House of Lords as the wildest and most extravagant scheme of all the wild and
extravagant ones he had ever listened to. Colonel Maberley, Secretary to the Post Office,
declared the experiment was certain to fail, though he was of opinion that no obstruction should be
placed in the way of it, lest the Government should afterwards be blamed for not giving it a trial.
Lastly, Sydney Smith may be quoted as
representing educated public opinion:
&ldquo;A million of revenue is given up,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;to the nonsensical Penny Post
Scheme, to please my old, excellent, and
universally dissentient friend, Noah Warburton.
I admire the Whig Ministry,
and think they have done more good
things than all the Ministries since the
Revolution; but these concessions are
sad and unworthy marks of weakness,
and fill reasonable men with alarm.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="caption"> INTERIOR OF THE GENERAL POST OFFICE AT THE TIME OF THE
INTRODUCTION OF PENNY POSTAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Warburton and Mr. Wallace
were the two members of Parliament
who most warmly advocated the project
of Rowland Hill. But credit is due to
the courage shown by Mr. Spring Rice,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, in
the face of a deficit of three-quarters of
a million, was bold enough to adopt the scheme and make provision for it in his Budget. Sir Robert
Peel and Mr. Goulbourn criticised the proposal mainly on the ground that it involved a risk of loss to
the revenue which ought not to be incurred in the existing state of the finances; but on a division the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
resolution was carried by a majority of 102, and the Bill carrying it into effect subsequently passed
without a division. This reform, the offspring of the genius of an obscure mathematical teacher, and
so modestly brought to light, has since been adopted by every civilised community in the world. To
realise the boon thereby conferred on commercial and general intercourse it is only necessary to
recall the postal regulations in force in Great Britain previous to 1839. Letters could not be prepaid;
the charge for postage varied according to distance, and also according to the weight, shape, and
size of letters. Thus, a letter posted in London for Brighton cost the recipient a fee of eightpence;
the rate from London to Aberdeen was 1<i>s.</i> 3½<i>d.</i>, and to Belfast 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> No wonder, then, that, in a
time of expanding trade, the Chancellor of the Exchequer found himself supported in his proposal
by countless petitions from commercial centres in favour of cheaper postage. But there was more
than this: there was the flagrant injustice of the system of official franks. Members of the
Government and of Parliament had the privilege of free postage, not only for their own letters but
for those of their friends by simply
writing their names on the cover.
This privilege had grown to the
dimensions of a gross abuse; people
who enjoyed the friendship of a
Minister were not the least shy of
pestering him for franks; the revenue
was defrauded, and those who were
least able to bear the cost had to
pay a high fee in order to recoup
the Department for the loss on
letters written by wealthy people.</p>

<p>Such being the case for reform
from a popular point of view, it
was hardly less urgent from a departmental
one. The Post Office
had then, as it has now, a monopoly
of conveying correspondence; but the high rates charged had driven people to various means of
infringing that monopoly. There had arisen all sorts of illegal and clandestine enterprises for carrying
letters at cheap rates. It had been proved before the Committee which considered Mr. Hill&rsquo;s
scheme that five-sixths of the correspondence between London and Manchester had been smuggled
for many years; one great firm having despatched sixty-seven letters by unlawful agency for every
one that went through the Post Office. Between 1815 and 1835 the population had increased by
thirty per cent., and the stage-coach duty by 128 per cent., yet the revenue of the Post Office had
remained stationary.</p>

<p>The proposed reduction from an average rate of sixpence farthing to one penny was certainly a
startling one. The Committee above referred to had recommended an uniform twopenny rate, but
Spring Rice told the House of Commons that he had become convinced that the loss to the revenue
(for no practical man, except, perhaps, Rowland Hill himself, doubted that loss there must be)
would be less from a penny rate. He estimated in his Budget the sacrifice at about £700,000.</p>

<p>The wildest enthusiasts can never have contemplated what have been the actual results as
revealed by the Post Office returns of 1895&ndash;6. In 1837 there were 80,000 letters and 44,000
newspapers delivered through the Post Office
in the United Kingdom&mdash;a total of 124,000
deliveries. In the twelve months of 1895&ndash;6 the
returns show that the deliveries (exclusive of
telegrams) amounted to the stupendous figure
of 3,031,553,196, representing 2,248 times the
volume of business transacted
in 1837, and producing
a nett profit of
£3,632,122.

Certain races of primitive savages,
it is said, have never acquired the art of counting
beyond two; everything beyond a pair
being reckoned as &ldquo;plenty.&rdquo; Such figures as
those quoted above baffle even ordinary civilised
powers of calculation; very few persons are
able to apprehend the idea of a million; much
less can they grasp the reality of growth represented
in thousands of millions. Perhaps, the
magnitude of the Post Office business at the present day can be best illustrated by its miscarriages.
The value of property found in letters
opened in the Returned Letter Offices
in 1896 amounted to £580,000.</p>

one were wanting, how men become

having returned from India at this time,
had re-entered Parliament as member for
Edinburgh, and joined the Cabinet as
Secretary for War. Greville quotes him

to that date, for he thought &ldquo;his time
had been thrown away upon <i>opuscula</i>
unworthy of his talents.&rdquo; He had resolved
to apply himself to serious work&mdash;the
History of England. But much
of his literary renown rests on these
<i>opuscula</i>: most people esteem Macaulay
the essayist far more highly than
Macaulay the historian or Macaulay the
Minister. Greville himself, in relating
this anecdote, unconsciously illustrates
the inability of men to judge of their
own performances. Speculating what
Macaulay might have been &ldquo;if he had

<p>Prince Albert, the second son of Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, by Louisa, daughter
of Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Attenburg, was very nearly the same age as the Queen,
having been born on August 26, 1819. Royal alliances
are so often the outcome of purely political or prudential
calculation that people are apt to assume that the deeper
personal feelings are not allowed to
weigh with the persons most concerned;
but young men and women
are not the less human because they are born in the
purple, and Queen Victoria&rsquo;s marriage was as much a
love match as that of any village maid.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Character of Prince Albert.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But she had
set her affections on one of a disposition and habits
not commonly to be found in any station of life. Not
only was Prince Albert remarkably handsome and amiable,
but he had sedulously cultivated natural gifts of a very
high order. He had made himself a good musician, he
had penetrated far in natural science, made a special
study of social politics, and was well read in general
literature. He was known to have steered a clear course
among the temptations which peculiarly beset a young man
of princely rank and fortune. All this he might have been,
and yet, had there not been something to balance it, he
might have proved no fitting consort of the young Queen
of the English. But there was another side to his character.
Erudite, he was completely without the fastidious or
shy manner which sometimes imparts a blemish to learning,
for his manner in society was extremely fascinating;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
of artistic tastes, he was soon to prove himself capable in business. Last, but not least, in
view of an English public, he was an accomplished horseman, and devoted to field sports.</p>

that Bradshaw had the tongue of a traitor and the heart
of a coward. After an exchange of shots, the seconds induced
Bradshaw to retract and apologise. It may be mentioned
here that the abolition of duelling was one of the first objects
to which Prince Albert devoted his efforts after his naturalisation.
He proposed the substitution of Courts of Honour to
arbitrate in quarrels between gentlemen, and though he did
not prevail on the Commander-in-Chief to establish these,
there can be no doubt that the Prince&rsquo;s personal influence
was greatly the cause of suppressing a system which was

One sometimes hears doubts
expressed about the necessity for the elaborate precautions taken for the safety
of Royal personages, who, it is supposed by some people, might safely trust themselves
more freely to the goodwill of their subjects. But there is nothing more certain than this&mdash;that,
however popular or deserving a monarch may be, there are always crazed or desperate individuals
with schemes of insult or violence, waiting an opportunity to carry them out.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">THE &ldquo;VOLAGE&rdquo; AND &ldquo;HYACINTH&rdquo; ENGAGING TWENTY-NINE CHINESE JUNKS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The relations of Great Britain and the East India Company with China had for some years been
drifting into very unfriendly conditions, arising out of the opium trade. The Chinese Government
had strictly prohibited the importation of opium&mdash;a measure commanding the sincere sympathy of
those in this country who condemned all use of opium as an unmitigated physical and moral evil.
But India derived enormous profits from the opium trade, and her traders used every device to evade
the restrictions. It was suspected, and the Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, endorsed the suspicion,
that the policy of the Chinese Government had nothing to do with the morality of the trade, but
was concerned only to protect the native opium industry.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>War declared with China.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The wheels of diplomacy ran heavily
between the &ldquo;Heavenly Dynasty&rdquo; and the British Foreign Office for many years,
till at last they were brought to a stand by the sudden outbreak of war. Lord
Palmerston had appointed three superintendents to look after the interests of
British traders in Chinese ports, and invested them with a semi-diplomatic character. Thus it
came to pass that when, after months of procrastination, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government at last
announced that &ldquo;they could not interfere for the purpose of enabling British subjects to violate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
laws of the country with which they traded,&rdquo; thus practically forbidding the opium trade, Captain
Elliott, the chief superintendent, read between the lines of the despatch, and, on the Chinese
authorities seizing a large quantity
of opium in British vessels, requested
the Governor of India to send warships
for the protection of Englishmen
trading in China. The request
was promptly complied with by the
despatch of two frigates, the <i>Volage</i>
and the <i>Hyacinth</i>, which attacked a
Chinese fleet of twenty-nine junks
below Hong Kong, blew up one of
them, sunk three, and knocked the
rest about in fine style.</p>

for peace were then opened, but the Chinese
authorities prolonged them on so many various
pretexts, while busily erecting batteries at the
Bogue, near Canton, that Commodore Bremer
broke off the proceedings and prepared for action.

The Bogue Forts were bombarded,

was re-opened on February 19, and
the whole chain of defences were taken. After
each successive engagement, Captain Elliott, the
civil superintendent, attempted to obtain a pacific
settlement with the enemy; but forbearance was
invariably interpreted by the Mandarin as a sign
of weakness, and it was not till the troops under
Sir Hugh Gough, had fought their way to the
walls of Canton that Captain Elliott was able
to announce that terms of peace had been agreed to, just forty-five minutes before a general attack
on Canton was to have taken place.</p>

The sword, long impending, descended at last. Mr. Baring,
who had succeeded Spring Rice as Chancellor of the Exchequer, had to confess to
a deficiency in his Budget of nearly two millions, which he proposed to meet by a
re-adjustment of the sugar and timber duties, which brought about the defeat of the Government
by a majority of thirty-six. Still, Ministers did not resign. Russell had
determined at length to make a bid for the Free Trade vote, and gave notice of
his intention to propose a permanent reduction in the duty on corn. But the
announcement fell flatly; people only saw in this sudden conversion another desperate effort to retain
office, for the Whigs hitherto had been inflexible in resistance to Free Trade demands. Melbourne
had sworn roundly that of all the mad projects he had ever heard of the surrender of duties was
the maddest; and Russell had been equally explicit, though employing fewer expletives. The duty
on imported corn had been established by legislation in 1815, and was on a sliding scale according
to current prices. The impost was 27<i>s.</i> on each quarter of wheat when the price fell below 60<i>s.</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
and diminished in proportion as the price rose till it stood at 1<i>s.</i> when the price of the quarter
was 73<i>s.</i> and upwards.</p>

The most serious reverse to British policy
and the greatest disaster to British arms which have happened in the present century were the
outcome of events which may thus briefly be recapitulated. In 1837 Captain Alexander Burnes,
Orientalist and traveller, arrived as British agent at Cabul, capital of the province of that name,
in the north of Afghanistan. The Prince of that fragment of the ancient Empire of Ahmed Shah
was Dost Mahomed Khan, an usurper, it is true, but a popular hero, a soldier of remarkable ability,
and a sagacious and bold ruler. Dost professed the friendliest feelings towards England, but, for
some reasons now unknown, was profoundly distrusted by the Foreign Office. Captain Burnes
thoroughly trusted Dost, but his repeated assurance failed to convince his employers that in his
disputes with neighbouring States,
Dost greatly preferred relying on
English influence to accepting the
advances continually made to him
by Russia and Persia. Burnes was
instructed to regard Dost as dangerously
treacherous, and at last
Lord Auckland, Governor-General of
India, made a treaty with Runjeet
Singh, hostile to Dost, and with the
purpose of restoring Shah Soojah-ool-Moolk,
whom Dost had deposed
from the throne of Cabul.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Afghan War.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
A British force invaded
Cabul, overthrew
the brave Dost, and enthroned Soojah,
whom nobody wanted. But
Dost Mahomed was a foe of no
ordinary mettle. On November 2,
1840, he encountered the allied
force of the English and Shah
Sooja at Purwandurrah, and if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
did not actually win the battle, the gallantry of his Afghan cavalry caused it to be drawn. Dost,
however, was too wise to believe that he could resist for long the force of England. On the evening
after the battle he rode into his enemy&rsquo;s camp and placed his sword in
the hand of Sir W. Macnaghten, the British Envoy at Soojah&rsquo;s Court. Dost
was honourably treated, his sword was returned to him, he was sent to India
and provided with a residence and pension.</p>

<p>But Dost was the darling of his people. They hated Soojah, whom the
English had forced on them, and they rose in revolt against him.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Murder of Sir A. Burnes and Sir W. Macnaghten.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Burnes was the earliest victim, for although, in truth, he had
all along stood stoutly for Dost, the insurgents believed
him to have betrayed their ruler. He and his brother
and all their party, man, woman, and child, were hacked
to pieces. Akbar Khan, second and favourite son of Dost Mahomed, now
put himself at the head of the insurrection, and the shameful part of the
story began. Hitherto, there had been blunders enough in English dealings
with this brave people: but there is nothing to blush for in blunders provided
they are clear of disgrace; one cannot, however, ignore the truth that,
after a few weeks&rsquo; fighting, British troops, having been repeatedly beaten,
became so demoralised that their officers could not get them to stand before
the fierce Afghans. General Elphinstone, the chief in command, was an
experienced, able soldier; but his health had broken down before the insurrection
began, and he had written to the Governor-General begging to be
relieved of his command, which he felt he was physically unfit to continue.
Unfortunately there was some delay in appointing his successor, and the
trouble came before Elphinstone could be relieved. Against the personal
courage of Brigadier Shelton, the second in command, no reflections have
ever been made, but he proved lamentably supine at moments when prompt action was most required.
Affairs went from bad to worse with the British force in cantonments outside Cabul, until at last
Elphinstone, grievously weakened by disease, could be brought to contemplate no course but abject
surrender. Abject surrender! not quite unconditional, it is true, but on most humiliating terms,
including the release of Dost Mahomed and the immediate evacuation of Cabul by the British.</p>

<p>Bad as this was there was darker disgrace to come. The evacuation was delayed&mdash;on the part
of the British from a foolish &ldquo;Micawber&rdquo; hope that &ldquo;something would turn up&rdquo;&mdash;on the part of
the Afghans, no doubt, in order that the advent of winter should make the passes impracticable.
Macnaghten, the British Envoy, seems to
have been infected by the prevailing demoralisation,
and fell into a trap prepared
for him by Akbar Khan. At the very
moment when he (Macnaghten) was negotiating
openly with the chiefs in Cabul
he entered into a conspiracy with Akbar to
destroy them, to establish Shah Soojah as
nominal monarch, and to secure the appointment
of Akbar as Vizier. Macnaghten&rsquo;s
punishment made no long tarrying, for
Akbar was acting a subtle part. Macnaghten,
accompanied by three officers,
rode out one morning to a conference with
Akbar on the west bank of the Cabul river.
It was a solitary place, as befitted the discussion
of the contemplated treachery, but
they had not been conferring long before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
they were surrounded by a crowd of armed country people. The British officers remonstrated with
Akbar; at that moment Macnaghten and his companions were seized from behind; a scuffle took
place; Akbar drew a pistol, a gift from the Envoy himself, and shot him
in the body. Macnaghten fell from his horse and was instantly hewn in
pieces; Captain Trevor was killed also, and the other two officers, Mackenzie
and Laurence, were carried off to the town.</p>

<p>The gate shown is the Cabul Gate of Jellalabad. It was from the top of that gate that the
sentry on duty first caught sight of the solitary figure, clad in sheepskin coat and riding a bay
pony, lean, hungry, and tired, who alone survived the massacres in the Khyber and Jugdulluck
Passes. Dr. Brydon&rsquo;s form was bent from weakness, and he was so worn out with fatigue that he
could scarcely cling to the saddle. The
snow-covered mountain in the background is the Ram
Koond.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Deeper and deeper grows the horror&mdash;more profound the shame&mdash;as
the story proceeds. General Elphinstone and Brigadier Shelton lay in their
cantonments with 4,500 fighting men, with guns, and camp followers to the
number of 12,000. Macnaghten&rsquo;s bloody remains were dragged in triumph
through the streets of Cabul, yet not an arm was raised to avenge him.
Major Eldred Pottinger was for cutting their way out and dying on the
field, but no one would listen to him: negotiations were
opened with Akbar Khan, and the British force were
allowed to march out, leaving all their guns except six,
all their treasure and six officers as hostages.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Retreat from Cabul.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
They started, upwards of
16,000 souls, to march through the stupendous Khyber Pass to Jellalabad
in the very depth of winter. Akbar Khan&rsquo;s
safe-conduct proved the shadow
of a shade; either he would not, or, as seems to have been the case, he
could not, protect them from hordes of fanatic Ghilzies, who hovered along
the route&mdash;shooting, stabbing, mutilating the wretched fugitives. Akbar,
indeed rode with Elphinstone, and probably it was true, as he declared, that
he could do nothing with his handful of horse to keep off the infuriated
hillmen. At last it became evident that a choice must be made of a few
who might be saved either from a bloody death or from perishing of cold
in the snow and searching wind. Akbar proposed to take all the women
and children into his own custody and convey them to Peshawur. The awful nature of the
dilemma may be imagined when such a proposal was agreed to. Lady Macnaghten was placed
in charge of the assassin of her husband: with her went Lady Sale, Mrs. Trevor, and eight
other Englishwomen; and, as an extreme favour, a few married men were allowed to accompany
their wives. General Elphinstone and two other officers were also taken as hostages. The rest
struggled on as far as the Jugdulluck
Pass. Then came the end: the hillsides
were crowded with fierce mountaineers;
the 44th Regiment were ordered to the
front; they mutinied and threatened to
shoot their officers, broke their ranks,
and were cut down in detail by the
Afghans. A general massacre followed.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Annihilation of the British Force.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Out of more than
16,000 souls who
marched out of Cabul,
a sorry score of fugitives were all
that left that horrible defile alive. Sixteen
miles from Jellalabad, only six remained:
still the murdering knife was
plied, until, at last, one solitary haggard
man, Dr. Brydon, rode into Jellalabad to
tell of the literal annihilation of the army
of Cabul, and announce to General Sale,
commanding in that place, that his wife
was in the hands of Akbar Khan.</p>

</div></div>

<p>There is little more to add. It had been part of Elphinstone&rsquo;s shameful bargain with Akbar
Khan that Jellalabad and Candahar should be evacuated before the army of Cabul should reach the
former place, and orders had been sent to General Sale in Jellalabad and General Nott in Candahar
to abandon these towns. Luckily, these officers were of the right British stamp, and they refused to
obey. Akbar Khan besieged Sale in Jellalabad; Sale not only held that place but gave battle
to the Afghans outside the fort, routed them, and made ready to co-operate with General Nott at
Candahar for a forward movement on Cabul. But the faculties of Lord Auckland, the Governor-General,
seemed paralysed. Regardless of British prestige, the very keystone of our rule in India,
he ordered the precipitate recall of all the troops in Afghanistan. Luckily, again, his term of office
was just drawing to a close, and Lord Ellenborough came out to take the reins of government. At
first he issued a proclamation endorsing the withdrawal from Afghanistan, but more spirited counsel
prevailed in the end. The re-conquest of Cabul was accomplished by the entry of General Pollock
into the capital on September 15, 1842, when it was found that the unfortunate Shah Soojah had
paid the penalty of the greatness thrust on him by English diplomacy, and had been assassinated
by the people he had been set to rule. Of the English ladies and children who had been taken under
the protection of Akbar Khan the story has been written in a once famous book, Lady Sale&rsquo;s
<i>Journal</i>. The husband of that lady, General Sir Robert Sale, was sent to recover the captives,
who had suffered innumerable hardships. General Elphinstone had died&mdash;the best thing that could
happen for his fame; the rest were found in a hill fort in the Indian Caucasus, in charge of a
chief, who, having heard of Akbar Khan&rsquo;s defeat, was easily bribed to surrender his trust. The retreat
from Cabul had begun on January 6, but the news did not reach England till March 7.</p>

He opposed the Crimean War, and brought about
the fall of the Palmerston Government in 1857, by
carrying a vote condemning their action in regard to
the Chinese War. He negotiated the commercial
treaty with France in 1860.</p>

<p>The Tories&mdash;or, as they must in future be called, the Conservatives&mdash;had been carried to
power by a strong wave of reaction in 1841, but it was the destiny of their leader, Sir Robert Peel,
to shake the fabric of the Party to its base. There was a story current, of dubious authenticity,
about this statesman, how that in his early days his father, also Sir Robert, warned Lord Liverpool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
that if the young man did not get office immediately he would go over to the Whigs and be
lost to his party, whereupon Liverpool immediately appointed him Irish Secretary. No doubt
Peel was far more disposed for progress and reform than the
average Whig, and there was something paradoxical in the fate
that made him leader of the Tories. At first all went smoothly;
the leader of the House of Commons was chief of the Ministerial
forces and master of the Opposition also. But the first note
of approaching storm was sounded on the eve of the meeting
of Parliament in February, 1842. The Duke of Buckingham,
Lord Privy Seal, resigned his office and seat in the Cabinet on
January 31. The reason for this, as the Duke afterwards announced
in Parliament, lay in the following expression in the Queen&rsquo;s
Speech:&mdash;&ldquo;I recommend to your consideration the state of the
laws which affect the importation of corn, and of other articles,
the produce of foreign countries.&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Corn Duties.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This little sentence, wedged
in among the usual ceremonial or occasional
paragraphs, contained the kernel of the Ministerial
programme, and at once excited extraordinary interest in
the country. On February 9, when Peel was to propound his
scheme, the delegates of the Anti-Corn Law League marched
down in procession to Westminster, and it required all the force
of the police on duty to keep them from taking possession of the
lobby of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>This League was a remarkable organisation under a no less
remarkable leader. Richard Cobden, the son of a yeoman farmer,
was employed in his youth in a London warehouse, and then
became partner in a Manchester cotton factory. He first attracted
notice as a pamphleteer, attacking some of the most cherished
traditions of British statesmanship. He travelled far and wide
on the business of his firm, and in every country he visited his
thoughtful mind gathered material for the doctrines
inseparably associated with his name.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Pioneers of Free Trade.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
He first entered Parliament in 1841, being
recognised at that time as the leader of the movement in the
country against the corn duties. Mr. Charles Villiers had won
for himself the position of parliamentary head of the Free
Trade party; to him Cobden came not as a rival but as a
wise, resourceful ally. A third figure was soon to be added
to this famous group in the person of John Bright, a Quaker
manufacturer in Rochdale. A notable trio, each supplying the
complement of the other&rsquo;s qualities; Villiers, of aristocratic birth
and connections, well acquainted with the rules and peculiar
temperament of the House of Commons, ardent, industrious, and
well informed; Cobden, a man of the people, temperate, just,
&ldquo;the apostle of common-sense,&rdquo; and singularly persuasive; Bright,
intensely&mdash;sternly in earnest, possessing gifts of oratory denied to
his colleagues, but exercising them with a discretion rare among
fluent speakers. Lastly, one attribute shared equally by each of
the three men&mdash;absolute integrity and complete disinterestedness.
They were Radicals, but they dissociated themselves from all ties
of political party, looking for no reward from either side, but
ready to support any Minister who would carry out their views.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Their appeal was addressed to the understanding, not to the passions, of men: their aim was to secure
cheap food for the masses, but they never stooped to inflammatory tirades against the classes. Hence
the steady, rapid growth of the League, and its irresistible influence
on the Queen&rsquo;s Ministers. Mr. Villiers had advocated
for many years the total abolition of the corn duties, and
nothing less would now satisfy the League. Russell, who scouted
the very idea of absolutely free imports, had yielded so far as to
propose, in 1841, a fixed duty on foreign corn, greatly less than
the existing rate, which varied between 27<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> per quarter,
according to the market price. Peel came forward in 1842
with a more liberal remission of duty, but although his Bill
was passed by a very large majority, all it did was to make
the country party behind him uneasy without conciliating the
Anti-Corn Law people. No one but men of the Manchester
school&mdash;&ldquo;Cobdenites,&rdquo; as
they afterwards came to
be called&mdash;no one, either
Whig or Tory, dreamt of denying that protection was desirable,
even necessary, for agriculture. Peel&rsquo;s first measure was framed
to protect wheat growers against a fall in the average price below
56<i>s.</i> a quarter, and also to protect the consumer against a higher
price. But the corn duties had been fixed in 1815: a whole
generation had grown up under them: their outworks could not
be tampered with without risking the stability of the whole structure.
It required a momentum of extraordinary force to carry
the movement against them to success. That impetus came, in
the autumn of 1845, from two sources equally unforeseen.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Failure of Potato Crop in Ireland.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
First arrived news of a destructive disease, wasting
the potato crop in Ireland. Potatoes had
grown to be to the Irish peasant what wheat
is to English, what oats still were to Scottish labourers. The
Government were informed that one-third of the food of the people
was already destroyed,
that the disease was still
spreading, and no estimate
could be formed of how
much of the crop could be
saved. Deadly disaster was imminent, and the Cabinet was
summoned to many anxious deliberations. The Prime Minister
advocated that in order to avert famine all ports should be
thrown open to corn ships. He coupled this advice with the
warning that, once the duties were suspended, he did not
think it would be possible to re-establish them. The warning
weighed more with the Cabinet than the advice. Three Ministers
only&mdash;Lord Aberdeen, Sir James Graham, and Sidney
Herbert&mdash;supported Peel&rsquo;s proposal. It was set aside, and a
Commission was appointed instead to take measures to mitigate
the immediate necessity in Ireland.</p>

<p>The immediate effect of Russell&rsquo;s conversion, coming on the top of alarming news from Ireland,
was to send Peel forward on a course he had been contemplating for years.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Peel and Repeal.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
He read a memorandum
to the Cabinet on December 2 recommending that Parliament should be
summoned early in January, and that he should submit a Bill for the practical
and immediate repeal of the Corn Laws. Lord Stanley and the Duke of Buccleuch refused their
support to this policy. The Duke of Wellington said he was still in favour of maintaining the Corn
Laws, but that if Peel considered that their repeal was necessary for the maintenance of his position
&ldquo;in Parliament and in the public view,&rdquo; he would support the measure. The Cabinet adjourned till
next day. By some accident&mdash;it was said that a lady was the means of it&mdash;the <i>Times</i> became
possessed of the secret, and on December 4 the startling announcement appeared in its columns that
the Cabinet had resolved on the Repeal of the Corn Laws. The only modern parallel to the
consternation ensuing in the clubs and the country may be found in that which took place when, in
1886, it was made known that Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Cabinet had decided to give Home Rule to Ireland.
Many refused to believe the statement in the <i>Times</i>, alleging that it was impossible that a Cabinet
secret could have leaked out in this way. The <i>Standard</i> published an emphatic, though not
authoritative, contradiction of the story. Excitement and dismay, delight and disgust, contended
for mastery wheresoever a few men gathered together: in a few days all was known. Lord Stanley&mdash;the
&ldquo;Rupert of debate,&rdquo; as Disraeli afterwards called him&mdash;and the Duke of Buccleuch resigned
their seats in the Cabinet. Peel would not consent to proceed without the unanimous consent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
his colleagues; on December 5 he went to Osborne and tendered his resignation to the Queen.

Lord John Russell was at once sent for to form a Ministry: he attempted to do so, but failed: Lord

foreign policy proving a fatal obstacle
to it. Peel, on being required
to do so by the Queen, withdrew his resignation and
resumed the duties of office. The Duke of Buccleuch
returned as Privy Seal, but Lord Stanley was not to be
reconciled, and Mr. Gladstone entered the Cabinet for

<p>The Irish Famine of 1845 caused Sir Robert Peel to embrace the principle

<p>Parliament met on January 22, 1846. Expectation
was at the boiling point; it was one of those rare
occasions, happening not more than once or twice in
an ordinary reign, when the ears of the whole country
await an announcement of interest to every class in it.
Adopting an unusual, almost unprecedented, course, the
Prime
Minister
rose immediately
after the speeches of the mover and seconder
of the Address: he entered into no details of the measure
foreshadowed in the Queen&rsquo;s Speech, but he removed
all shadow of doubt that the Ministry had
resolved on the total repeal of the
corn duties.

will best understand the significance of a comment
made by one who was present. &ldquo;He did not get a
solitary cheer from the people behind him except when
he said that Stanley had always been against him ... and
then the whole of those benches rung with cheers.&rdquo;
Perhaps nothing in his speech gave deeper offence to
his Party than the concluding sentence,
in which he declared that he found it
&ldquo;no easy task to ensure the harmonious

eastward in 10 days. In 1851 the record was reduced to 9 days 18 hours westward by the <i>Baltic</i>,
and 9 days 20 hours 16 min. eastward by the <i>Pacific</i>. In 1863 the <i>Scotia</i>, of the Cunard line, crossed
eastward in 8 days 3 hours, and in the following year returned in 8 days 15 hours 45 min. Five
years later the <i>City of Brussels</i>, of the Inman Line, travelled between New York and Liverpool in
7 days 22 hours 3 min., but the <i>Baltic</i>, of the White Star Line, lowered this by 2 hours four years
later. The <i>Arizona</i> and <i>Alaska</i> improved the speed between 1880 and 1885, the latter making
the passage eastward in 6 days 22 hours. The ill-fated <i>Oregon</i> came eastward in 6 days 11 hours 9 min.
in 1884, while the <i>Etruria</i> went westward in 6 days 1 hour 55 min. In 1889 the <i>City of Paris</i>
lowered the eastward and westward journeys to 5 days 22 hours 50 min., and 5 days 19 hours 18 min.,
respectively, while two years later the <i>Teutonic</i> reduced this still further by 3 hours each way.
Finally the <i>Campania</i> and <i>Lucania</i> appeared in 1893, the latter establishing the record eastwards
of 5 days 8 hours 38 min. and westwards of 5 days 7 hours 23 min. Mails have been carried per

was one of whom much was to be heard
in coming years. Benjamin Disraeli
had done nothing as yet to redeem the
apparently hopeless failure of his maiden
speech in 1837. Outwardly, a remarkable
figure enough, in a Parliamentary sense
he was no more than obscure when he
rose from his seat on the Government
benches to lead the first attack on the new
policy. He was bitter, he was personal,
but he was adroitly opportune; and his
fame as a statesman dates from that day.</p>

<p>The opportunity for vengeance was not long delayed. The
Corn Bill left the House of Commons on May 15. On June 25
it passed the third reading in the House of Lords, and the most
momentous measure of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s reign awaited only the
Royal Assent to complete it. On that very night the House of
Commons were to divide on one of those Bills conferring extraordinary
powers on the Executive in Ireland which it has been the
fate of successive Governments to introduce&mdash;Coercion Bills, as
they are called for short. The Protectionists perceived what lay
in their power: if they threw their weight in with the regular
Opposition and O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s Irish Catholics, they could defeat their
lost leader. About eighty of them did so: the rest stayed away
and Ministers were left in a minority of seventy-three.</p>

<p>Peel resigned: &ldquo;he had lost a party but won a nation.&rdquo; He
never returned to office, but, though he did not live to see it, the
principles for which he fought and fell became those of the
Conservative party.</p>

Mr. Gladstone

with it. Peel&rsquo;s Administration must also be credited with a marked advance in legislation for the
working classes. Lord Ashley (better
known in later years as Earl of
Shaftesbury) had obtained the appointment
of a Commission to inquire into
the employment of women in collieries:
the horrible evils thereby brought to
light, the infamous degradation of
women and girls, harnessed like beasts
of draught with a girdle round their
waist&mdash;unclothed, unwashed, and sometimes
hopelessly crippled&mdash;deeply moved
the public mind, and the Act of 1842,
prohibiting the employment of females
in mines, passed almost without
opposition. More prolonged was the
resistance to the Factory Act of
1844, regulating the hours of labour
of youthful persons. This beneficent
legislation should not be overlooked
in the glare of conflict over the Corn
Laws.</p>

had passed after the agitating
events of the seventeenth century,
and an attempt on the

About the same time began the publica&shy;tion of &ldquo;Tracts for the
Times,&rdquo; conducted by a group of earnest,
active men, including Newman, Keble, Pusey,
and others, advocating a revival of High
Church observances as a means of quickening
spiritual life and a restoration of the patristic doctrines and practice
in Church government and services. From these tracts the
movement became known as &ldquo;Tractarian,&rdquo; till in 1841 their
publication came to a sudden end by reason of the famous Tract
No. 90, written by Newman, and deeply offensive to Protestant
feeling in England. Newman joined the Church of Rome in
1845, and thereafter the term &ldquo;Puseyite&rdquo; was popularly used to
designate this party.</p>

<p>As minister of the Tron Church, Glasgow (1815),

<p>The corresponding movement in the Established Presbyterian

Lay patronage had been imposed on the Church
of Scotland by the Act of 1712. The revival of spiritual activity,
which in England took the shape of the Tractarian movement,
was equally perceptible in Scotland, and resulted in the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland passing the Veto Act in
1834, by which it was declared to be a fundamental law of the
Church that no pastor could be appointed to a parish against the
will of the majority of the
congregation. It was not long
before this led to appeals from the Ecclesiastical to the Civil
Courts.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Disruption of the Church.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In 1842 the General Assembly presented to the Queen a
&ldquo;claim, declaration, and protest,&rdquo; accompanied
by an address praying for the abolition of
patronage, to which the Home Secretary made
reply that the Government could not interfere. In March 1843,
the House of Commons decided by 211 votes to 76 against
attempting to redress the grievance, and on May 18 following, the
non-intrusion party withdrew from the General Assembly and
constituted the first Assembly of the Free
Church, under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Chalmers.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Dr. Chalmers.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The action was all the more significant because
Chalmers, the most powerful and popular preacher in the Scottish
Church of that day, and a distinguished leader of ecclesiastical
thought, had hitherto been a powerful champion of the connection
of Church and State. But he had thrown himself with great
earnestness into the work of reclaiming the masses and bringing
them into direct relations with the Church, and he felt convinced
that this great work could not be carried to
success unless the Church were free to choose
her own instruments.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Rise of the Free Church.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Four hundred and
seventy parish ministers resigned their livings and joined the
Free Church. A sustentation fund was set up, based on a
calculation made by Chalmers that a penny a week from each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
member of a congregation would produce a stipend of £150 a year for 500 ministers. It
amounted to no less than £367,000 in the first year of disruption.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">General Sir Charles Napier,<br />1782&ndash;1853.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The existence of British territory in India, side by side
with territory under British protection and States wholly
under native rule, was a condition of things neither conducive
to peace nor likely to be of a permanent nature.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Affairs of British India.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
A single
spark dropped among the warlike races inhabiting that vast
peninsula was often enough to cause
wide-spreading conflagration; and, however
agreeable it might be to British consciences,
it would be unphilosophic in the highest degree to
attribute the blame for such outbreaks exclusively to the
native rulers and people. Trouble broke out early in 1843
which led to the annexation by the British of Scinde, a fine
territory lying between the Indian Ocean and the Cutch on
the south, and southern Afghanistan and the Punjab on the
north. Scinde had been divided into three provinces&mdash;Hyderabad,
Khyrpore, and Meerpore&mdash;each ruled by a group of
Ameers or hereditary chiefs, descended from Beloochee conquerors,
who, it was said, most cruelly oppressed the people
under them. Successive treaties had been effected with these
rulers by the Indian Government, but the disaster which fell
on the British arms in Cabul seems to have encouraged them
to withhold some of the tribute due by them under the latest
treaty, and they began warlike preparations.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The First Sikh War.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In 1842 Lord
Ellenborough appointed Sir Charles Napier
Commander-in-Chief of the British troops in Scinde, with instructions to inflict
signal punishment on any chiefs detected in treachery, at the same time empowering him to make a
fresh treaty, relieving the Ameers from the payment of any subsidy for the support of British troops.
This treaty was at length signed, though it must be confessed that the Ameers were only induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
to consent to it by the threatening display of Napier&rsquo;s force. On February 15, 1843, the British
Residency at Hyderabad was attacked by 8,000 troops with six guns, led by one or more of the
Ameers, and the garrison of 100 men under Major Outram was driven out after a gallant resistance.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Battles of Meeanee, Moodkee, Ferozeshah, Aliwal and Sobraon.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Napier marched to Muttaree the following day with a force of 3,000, attacked the Ameers, who had
an army of 22,000 Beloochees, on the morning of the 17th at Meeanee, six miles
from Hyderabad, defeated them, and captured their whole artillery, ammunition,
baggage, and considerable treasure. The British loss amounted to 256 killed and
wounded. Hyderabad was occupied, but the Ameer of Meerpore was still under
arms, holding a strong position at Dubba, about four miles from Hyderabad, with 20,000 men. Napier
attacked him, and a battle lasting for three hours ended in the complete defeat of Shere Mahomed
and the occupation of Meerpore by the British. Sir Charles Napier continued warlike operations at
intervals against the hill tribes north of Shikarpore, and there can be but one opinion of the masterly
way in which he handled the troops under his command. But the policy of the Governor-General
was open to some difference of opinion. He had carried things with a high hand in dealing with
the Ameers, and early in 1844 he was recalled by the unanimous vote of the Court of Directors of the
East India Company, and Sir Henry Hardinge was appointed in his place.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Hardinge applied himself to the peaceful preparation of railroad schemes for the development of
India, but at the close of 1845 events again forced the Government forward on the path of fresh
conquest. At that time the Punjab, a kingdom consisting both of independent Sikh States and
those under British protection, was under nominal rule of the boy-king, Dhuleep Singh, and his
mother, the Ranee; but his government at Lahore was distracted by faction and lay at the mercy of
his own powerful army. In December 1845, the Sikh forces, for some reason which has never been
clearly explained, began massing on the British frontier, and crossed the Sutlej, 15,000 or 20,000
strong, on the 13th. Sir Hugh Gough advanced by forced marches to meet them, attacked them at
Moodkee and defeated them, capturing seventeen guns. The Sikhs retired to a strongly-entrenched
camp at Ferozeshah, whither Gough, reinforced by Sir John Littler&rsquo;s division from Ferozepore,
followed them on the 21st. The Sikh army was now upwards of 50,000 strong, with 108 heavy
guns in fixed batteries. The British force consisted of 16,700 men and sixty-nine guns, chiefly horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
artillery. There ensued one of the severest conflicts in the history of our Indian Empire. Beginning on
the 21st it lasted through part of the 22nd, and ended in the gallant Sikhs being driven across the Sutlej
with the loss of many killed and wounded, and no less than seventy guns. The Governor-General, Sir
Henry Hardinge, acted as a volunteer, second in command to Sir Hugh Gough, in this memorable action.</p>

Sobraon, and was raised to the Peerage as a reward for these great victories. In
the second Sikh War in 1848 he commanded in the actions at Chilianwalla and
Goojerat.</p>
</div>

<p>Early in January 1846, Sirdar Runjoor Singh, again advancing towards the frontier, took up a
strong position on the British side of the Sutlej, threatening Gough&rsquo;s line of communications with
Loodiana. Major-General Sir Harry Smith attacked him at Aliwal on January 28, and, notwithstanding
the great superiority in numbers of
the enemy, obtained a brilliant victory over the
Sikhs, capturing their camp and fifty-two guns.
But more fighting had to be done before the
army of the Punjab could be finally subdued.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Second Sikh War.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Sikhs still lay at Sobraon with 30,000 of
their best troops, defended
by a triple line of breastworks,
flanked by redoubts, and armed with
seventy guns. Here Sir Hugh Gough attacked
them on the morning of February 10, the
Governor-General again being present as second
in command. At nine o&rsquo;clock, after an hour&rsquo;s
cannonade, Brigadier Stacey advanced to storm
the entrenchments with four battalions, which
behaved with splendid gallantry under a very
heavy and well-directed fire. They stormed the
position, and, being well supported, forced their
way into the fortress. By eleven o&rsquo;clock all
was over. The Sikhs were in full flight across
the Sutlej, leaving behind them piles of dead
and wounded, sixty-seven guns, 200 camel
swivels, and all their baggage and ammunition.
The British loss consisted of 320 killed, including
seventeen officers (among whom were Major-General
Sir Robert Dick, General McLaren,
and Brigadier Taylor), and 2,063 wounded, including
139 officers. But the carnage among the
Sikhs was far more terrible. It is supposed that
not less than eight or ten thousand of them
perished in action or were drowned in crossing
the river under the fire of the British artillery.
On February 22 Gough occupied the citadel of
Lahore; the Governor-General issued a proclamation
from that place, and a treaty was subsequently
concluded establishing Dhuleep Singh as Maharajah,
tributary to the British Government.</p>

<p>War broke out again in the Punjab in 1848. On April 17 Mr. Vans Agnew and Lieutenant
Anderson, British Agents at Mooltan, were murdered. On August 18 General Whish besieged
Mooltan with 28,000 men.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Murder of Vans Agnew and Anderson. Battle of Ramnuggur.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Lord Gough arrived on November 21, and took
command of the entire British force. Next day he advanced to attack the enemy
at Ramnuggur, where both banks of the river were held by the Sikhs. By a most
unfortunate piece of strategy the cavalry division, consisting of the 3rd Dragoons
and the 5th, 8th, and 14th Light Horse, supported by Horse Artillery, were ordered forward under
General Cureton to dislodge the enemy from the left bank of the river. This they accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
with admirable gallantry, but not without suffering terrible loss, owing to the difficult nature of the
ground. Colonel Havelock fell at the head of the 14th Light Dragoons; General Cureton and
Captain Fitzgerald were also killed. On December 2 Lord Gough crossed the Chenab, and the
enemy, after exchanging a cannonade for several hours, retired towards the north-west.</p>

<p>While the events recorded in these chapters were
enacting, those books were appearing in rapid succession
which have made Dickens&rsquo;s name a household
word. Dickens was born at Portsmouth, where his
father held an appointment in the Navy Pay Office.
In early life he learned by experience what poverty
meant; but his earliest writings, the &ldquo;Sketches by
Boz&rdquo; (1836), brought him immediate celebrity. The
&ldquo;Pickwick Papers&rdquo; appeared in 1837, then in
succession, &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge.&rdquo;
&ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; appeared in 1850, and &ldquo;Edwin

author died. He is buried in Poet&rsquo;s Corner, Westminster

<p>Meantime, General Whish was carrying on the siege of Mooltan with an army of 32,000 men
and 150 guns. It is impossible to speak too highly of the splendid defence made by the Sikhs under
Moolraj.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Siege and Fall of Mooltan.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
By December 29 the British siege
guns were bombarding the city walls at eighty
yards range. On the 30th the principal magazine
in the citadel blew up with a terrific explosion, and the
town was in flames. Still the brave garrison fought on. The
bombardment continued without intermission for fifty hours. On
January 2, 1849, the town, or the wreck of what had once been
a town, was taken by assault; but the citadel still held out.
From the 4th to the 18th it was incessantly bombarded, and
mines were exploded at intervals under the walls, till at last, on
the 21st, two wide breaches had been made, and a general assault
was ordered for the following day. Moolraj anticipated this by
unconditional surrender. His garrison, less than 4,000 men,
marched into the British lines to lay down their arms; the last
man to leave the fort, in the heroic defence of which he had won
undying glory, was Moolraj, dressed in gorgeous silks, splendidly
armed, riding a superb Arab with a scarlet saddle-cloth.</p>

<p>After the fall of Mooltan General Whish joined forces with
Lord Gough, who, as described above, had driven the enemy
from their encampment at
Ramnuggur on November 22.
It was believed that the rebellion
was broken, and that
the Sikhs would not again
meet our army in the field.
But our generals had still
to learn the extraordinary
resolution and resources of
this fine race. Chuttur Singh
and his son Shere Singh still commanded nearly 40,000 men with
sixty-two guns, and had captured Attock, a fort defended by Major Herbert.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Battles of Chilianwalla and Goojerat.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Gough advanced to attack
the chiefs on January 13, 1849, in their
position on the Upper Jhelum near the village
of Chilianwalla, a name of melancholy associations in British
annals. The Sikhs, indeed, withdrew, but they carried with them
four British guns and five stand of colours. The British loss
was terrible, amounting to twenty-six officers and 731 men killed,
and sixty-six officers and 1,446 men wounded. Lord Gough was
blamed for bad generalship in this action: he was recalled from
his command, and Sir Charles Napier was appointed in his place.
But fortune was kind to a brave soldier. Before the orders from
home could reach him, Gough, having followed the enemy, retrieved the disaster of Chilianwalla by
inflicting on Shere Singh a crushing defeat at Goojerat on February 21, pursuing him into the Khoree
Pass. On March 6 Shere Singh surrendered unconditionally, and on the 29th a proclamation was
issued by the Governor-General permanently annexing the Punjab to the British Empire.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the situation was one of extraordinary perplexity. In
the footprints of famine stalked sedition. Agrarian murders rose to a
frightful figure; secret societies grew apace; midnight drilling went on
in almost every county; and that very peasantry whose destitution had
touched the hearts of the whole civilised world, proved themselves able
to buy enormous quantities of arms and ammunition. In Clonmel

to quote a letter written at the time, &ldquo;the peasantry are armed or
are arming almost to a man. The stores of the armourer are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
frequently exhausted than the provision stores.&rdquo; So brisk was the demand as to cause a revival of
the gun trade in Birmingham, where the existing stock of small arms was entirely cleared out.
But there could be no doubt of the
reality and severity of the distress. It was
worst in the south and west; famine and
famine-fever carried off thousands, and the
population of Ireland, which had stood
at eight millions in 1845, could only be
reckoned at six millions in 1848. The
difference, however, was not entirely due
to deaths by starvation or disease. The
westward stream of emigration had set in,
and tens of thousands of Irish families
sought and found the means of better existence
in the land of plenty beyond the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>But the ferment of rebellion was
spreading swiftly among those who remained.
All the misery of the famine
was laid at the door of the land system;
not unfrequently coroners&rsquo; juries returned
verdicts of wilful murder against the Prime
Minister or Lord Lieutenant, holding them
directly responsible for not averting the disasters
of the country. Once more the Government
had to undertake the hateful task of
bringing forward a Coercion Bill, for the people
seemed on the brink of civil war. Technically
that limit was actually transgressed,
though the means were ludicrously inadequate
to the end&mdash;repeal of the Union. The
&ldquo;Young Ireland&rdquo; party, inflamed by the successful
revolution in France, separated from
and plunged ahead of O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s Repealers.
O&rsquo;Connor had precipitated the rupture by
endeavouring to induce his party to pledge
themselves against any except constitutional
means. His proposal was laughed to scorn.
William Smith O&rsquo;Brien, brother of Lord
Inchiquin, claiming descent from Brian
Boruibh, placed himself at the head of
the &ldquo;Confederates,&rdquo; as the new party
was called, with Meagher, Dillon, and
others as his lieutenants; the <i>United Irishman</i>
newspaper was started in opposition to
the less inflammatory <i>Nation</i>, the organ of
the older party. It was managed by John
Mitchell, who filled its columns week by
week with the most violent and acrid
sedition.</p>

<p>The first light-vessel was moored at the Nore in 1732. Since that date, to the
untechnical eye, the change in the outward appearance of a lightship has not been
great; but the efficiency of the light has been increased, since 1837, from about
1,500 candles to about 20,000 candles. The <i>Spurn</i> Lightship shows a light of the
power just named, and in foggy weather sounds a powerful siren in place of the

<p>It was impossible for the Government to allow this sort of stuff to be circulated among an
excitable peasantry, smarting under imaginary wrongs and real distress and armed to the teeth;
but the existing law contained no provisions framed to stop it. The Prime Minister, therefore,
introduced and passed what is known as the Treason Felony Act, making written incitement to
insurrection a crime punishable with transportation, and enabling the Executive to imprison persons
charged with contravention of it. Mitchell was arrested at once, but Smith O&rsquo;Brien continued to
hold armed meetings in various parts of Ireland: matters looked threatening, and there was grave
apprehension in England as to the result. On the morning of August 7 it was turned into mirth by
the arrival in London from Liverpool of one of the first telegraphic despatches of importance ever
published in this country.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Smith O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Rebellion.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Rebellion had actually broken out: Smith O&rsquo;Brien in person had led a
considerable force to attack a body of fifty or sixty police, who defended themselves
in the house of one Widow Cormack, near Ballingarry, in Tipperary. A
good deal of firing took place but very little bloodshed; thanks, on the one hand,
to the indifferent arms carried by the rebels, and, on the other, to the forbearance of the police,
who could easily have shot O&rsquo;Brien, so theatrically did he expose himself during the brief contest.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Widow Cormack&rsquo;s Cabbages.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The chief damage was done to the poor widow&rsquo;s cabbages, which the Confederates
trampled to pieces in the garden adjoining the house. The affair was soon over:
the patriots, not relishing a few rounds from the muskets of the police, melted
quickly away, and the heroic O&rsquo;Brien was arrested in the act of taking his railway ticket at Thurles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
station. It is unlucky for any cause&mdash;it is worse, it is fatal to it&mdash;when it becomes ridiculous, and
people have never since been able to mention Smith O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s cabbage garden without a grin. But
the general state of Ireland had grown to be
no laughing matter.

deal with, and a special

appointed to try them.</p>

<p class="alone">The spirit of revolution was astir in many
lands besides Ireland in the year when Louis
Philippe was forced from the throne of France.
In England the Chartist movement was sympa&shy;thet&shy;ic&shy;ally
inflamed into renewed activity.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Revival of the Chartist Movement.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
A Chartist convention
assembled in London in spring and
made arrangements for a monster demonstration
to be held on Kennington
Common on April 10. But the Convention had hardly
begun deliberating before disunion appeared in its councils.
There were two parties among the Chartists&mdash;the constitutional
Radicals and the physical force party. The latter
were for assembling on Kennington Common under arms;
but the venerable leader of the whole movement, Feargus
O&rsquo;Connor, would have nothing to do with unconstitutional or
violent proceedings. The consequence of this
was a rupture in the camp. Every preparation
was made by the authorities to protect
London from the ravages of a mob: the
troops were under arms: the police mustered
in great force: thousands of special constables
were sworn in, and the Chartist procession
was prohibited. But about 20,000 Chartists
did assemble on the Common to listen to
harangues by O&rsquo;Connor and others. O&rsquo;Connor
then went to the Home Office, interviewed
Sir George Grey, and told him the meeting
had taken place without disorder. &ldquo;Are you
going back to it?&rdquo; asked Grey. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
replied O&rsquo;Connor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my toes trodden on till I&rsquo;m lame: my pocket has been picked, and
I&rsquo;ll have no more to do with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was ridicule&mdash;that universal solvent&mdash;which finally shattered this once formidable Chartist
League. A monster petition to Parliament had been in course of signature for some months.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Monster Petition.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Feargus O&rsquo;Connor, in presenting it, declared that 5,700,000 names were
attached to it. It was remitted in the ordinary
course to the Committee on Public
Petitions, who employed a number of clerks to examine the
signatures. The result was speedily made known. Instead of
nearly six million names, less than
two million were appended to it.
Whole sheets of these were found
to have been written by the same hand.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Its Exposure, and Collapse of the Movement.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But the crowning exposure,
which convulsed the whole nation
with laughter,
appeared from
the analysis
of the names
themselves. Those of the Queen
and Prince Albert, of Ministers
and leaders of Opposition were of
frequent occurrence; noted names
in fiction, especially that of &ldquo;Cheeks
the Marine,&rdquo; a familiar character in
Marryat&rsquo;s novels, then very popular,
appeared in every sheet, besides all
sorts of ribaldries, indecencies, and buffooneries. Chartism was a
genuine and an earnest movement: it was an upheaval against class
privileges, a revolt against class grievances. But these privileges and
grievances were in course of removal; the extension of the franchise
had brought about repeal of the corn laws, laid the foundation of free
trade, and redressed some, at least, of the evils prevalent in factories
and mines. Much remained to be done, which has been done since,
but Chartism was to have no hand in the doing of it. As a political
force it collapsed; as a social movement it crumbled away under the
intolerable ridicule of the Monster Petition.</p>

<p>It will be long before English statesmen forget the lessons of
1848&ndash;9. During these years the whole of Europe was convulsed by
violent popular conflicts with authority. In France the Bourbon dynasty
collapsed with the abdication of Louis Philippe, and then, to repeat
Mr. Justin McCarthy&rsquo;s happy phrase, &ldquo;came a Red Republican rising
against a Republic that strove not to be red,&rdquo; to
be drowned in blood by Cavaignac.

The Pope
was chased from Rome, the Emperor of Austria

the German rulers from their principalities; there
were sanguinary struggles in Poland, in Naples, in Sardinia; while
Great Britain had only to blush for Widow Cormack&rsquo;s cabbages and
the picking of Feargus O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s pocket at Kennington. Yet there
was no doubt of the earnestness of the leaders of agitation and insurrection
in England: no question about the reality of the grievances.</p>

COSTUME OF 1846.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Freedom of speech and freedom of the press, no ineffective safety valves in times of discontent,
were tolerated in the United Kingdom&mdash;then, as now&mdash;far beyond the limits of public security, as
these were reckoned by every other European State. But the
chief safety of England lay in the faith of the masses in the power
of Parliament to devise measures of redress, and their confidence
that the Sovereign would interpose no bar to remedial legislation.
Nor have that faith and confidence been betrayed. Throughout all
the years that have elapsed since the dissolution of the Chartist
League, Parliament has been diligent in devising measures to meet
the ever-changing and growing wants of the people, and the Royal
Assent has always been cordially given to them. The Queen and
her Consort do not appear very prominently or very often in the
chronicles of these early years, but all the time there had been
growing silently that popular affection for the Sovereign which
disappeared entirely from practical politics with the active reign of
George III. The qualities of Prince Albert, his industry, his
untiring anxiety for the welfare of the people, his unobtrusive
influence in favour of freedom, were becoming known: the Crown
was becoming more than the decorative centre of the Court&mdash;the
mere frontispiece of the aristocracy&mdash;it was becoming recognised
as the actual head of the British people.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Growing Affection for the Queen. Its Causes.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The growing affection of the people for their Queen was
stimulated about this time by the act of a
harebrained scamp who, on May 17, discharged
a rusty pistol, loaded, it is believed, with no
deadly missile, at Her Majesty as she was driving in Constitution Hill with three of her children. The
fact that the wretch was an Irishman was regarded rightly as being of no
political significance, and it was a happy&mdash;it was more, it was a wise&mdash;project
which was carried into effect by the visit of the Queen and Prince Albert, with
the Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, to Ireland in August 1849.

The Royal yacht was escorted

and misunderstandings might never have taken place.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary session of 1850 must ever be memorable for two events&mdash;the sudden rise
of Lord Palmerston into fame and popularity, and the equally sudden removal of the most illustrious
figure in the House of Commons. The debate, which was the occasion of the first, and immediately
preceded the second of these events, arose out of one of the
most trivial and least creditable matters that ever agitated the
Councils and menaced the peace of a great nation. Certain
British subjects had suffered loss in the destruction of their
property during the disturbances at Athens in 1847, and had
lodged claims for compensation against the Greek Government.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Pacifico Imbroglio.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The principal sufferer was a Portuguese Jew,
named Pacifico, a British subject in virtue
of having been born in Gibraltar. The
Greeks were needy and delayed a settlement. Then there was
Mr. Finlay, too, the historian of Greece, long resident at Athens,
who had a grievance of a different sort, arising out of a demand
made by the Greek Government that he should surrender a
piece of land at less than he considered its value. The strange
thing was that Palmerston took up these private claims as an
international question, although neither of the claimants had
tried the experiment of litigation in the Greek courts. A British
squadron was ordered to the Piræus, all the Greek vessels in
that harbour were seized, and Athens was blockaded. The
Greeks appealed to the governments of France and Russia,
who remonstrated with Great Britain touching this high-handed
dealing with a weak State. Russia was rudely outspoken and menacing: she was told bluntly by
Lord Palmerston that it was none of her business. France was more conciliatory, and by
her aid a convention in regard to the disputed claims was arranged in London. But there
was so much delay in communicating the
result to the British Ambassador in Athens,
Mr. Wyse, that he was left in ignorance that
a modified payment had been agreed on, and
continued to press for payment of the full claims.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Rupture with France Imminent.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Thereupon arose serious misunderstanding
between the British and French
Governments, England being
accused of breach of
faith. Appearances were
certainly against her; the French Ambassador
was recalled from London, and two great
nations seemed on the brink of war.</p>

case to defend in Parliament; a case, too,
which had been damaged by the introduction
of that element which had told with such
fatal effect against the Chartists and Smith
O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Confederates&mdash;the element of ridicule.
For the grasping Jew Pacifico had specified
in his bill against the Greek Government various possessions strangely out of keeping with
what had always been his modest household. Among the articles alleged to have been destroyed
by fire were a bedstead, valued at £150, sheets for the same at £30, and a pillow-case at £10.
Ministers already beaten in the Upper House stood in a critical position in the Lower. But
Lord Palmerston rose to the occasion, and exhibited eloquence which hitherto he had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
suspected of possessing. He spoke with great vigour for nearly five hours, and wound up with a
peroration which, spoken by a man of other mould than &ldquo;Old Pam,&rdquo; might have savoured of claptrap,

<p>Sir Robert Peel made his last speech in opposition to the vote of confidence: though, in
referring to Palmerston&rsquo;s defence of the Government, he declared that &ldquo;his speech made us all proud
of the man who made it.&rdquo;
He delivered his last vote
on the fourth day of the
debate, about four o&rsquo;clock in the morning of
June 29. Next day at noon he attended a
meeting of the Royal Commissioners of the
Great Exhibition which was to be held
the following year. After the meeting he
mounted his horse, went to write his name
in the Queen&rsquo;s book at Buckingham Palace,
and then rode up Constitution Hill. He
stopped to talk to the Hon. Miss Ellis, whom
he met riding down from Hyde Park:
something frightened his horse, which,
by a sudden bound, unseated him. Peel
in falling kept hold of the reins and
pulled the horse on the top of him.
He was internally and fatally injured,
one of his ribs having been broken and
forced into the lung.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s Death.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
He died on July 2,
after terrible suffering.
The doctors were unable to deal
with the injuries owing to the intense agony caused by the slightest movement. It brings to one&rsquo;s
apprehension what an incalculable boon to suffering humanity has since that time been discovered in the
use of anæsthetics. Chloroform had already been invented, it is true, in 1850; but its employment was
little understood. Three years earlier Charles Greville had witnessed one of the first operations under
chloroform in St. George&rsquo;s Hospital. How many suffering ones and friends of suffering ones have had
cause to echo the feeling expressed in his journal: &ldquo;I have no words to express my admiration for this
invention, which is the greatest blessing ever bestowed on mankind, and the inventor of it the greatest
of benefactors, whose memory ought to be venerated by countless millions for ages yet to come.&rdquo; In
spite of this, it is greatly to be feared that the names of Guthrie the American and Soubeiran the
Frenchman, who simultaneously discovered chloroform in 1831, and Lawrence of London and Simpson
of Edinburgh, who first employed it in our hospitals, have been almost forgotten by the many.</p>

Added to this was the
active part he took in schemes of social and commercial improvement, and in
scientific and artistic progress. An early riser at all times, it was his custom,
summer and winter, to dispose of a couple of hours&rsquo; work before breakfast, and it is no figure of
speech to say that few of the Queen&rsquo;s subjects can have been more constantly or more laboriously
employed than her husband. The Prince had lived down any popular prejudice which he had to
encounter in the early years of his

and appreciate his abilities and
disposition, and the time had come
when his genius and industry were to
bear remarkable fruit.</p>

<p>Prince Albert was President of the
Society of Arts, a body which, dating
from the middle of the eighteenth
century, had, from time to time, offered
prizes for specimens of British textile,
ceramic, and other manufactures; but
the project of holding a competitive
Exhibition on an international scale
originated with the Prince himself.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>His Proposal for a Great Exhibition.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In the course of July
1849 he had laid
his proposals before
some of the members of the Society,
and means were at once adopted to
arouse the interest of manufacturers at
home, abroad, and in the colonies, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
open negotiations with foreign governments. The idea caught on at once; the States of Europe were at
peace, and nothing could more surely tend to obliterate the recollection of recent disturbances than to
join in friendly rivalry in the arts of peace.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Adoption of the Scheme.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
A Royal Commis&shy;sion was appointed to
carry out the preparations, and the scheme was formally inaugurated on March 21,
1850, at a banquet given by the Lord Mayor to the Chief Magistrates of all the
towns in the United Kingdom, to which Prince Albert and the foreign Ambassadors were also invited.</p>

<p>Somerset House had been placed at the disposal of the Commissioners for the purposes of the
Exhibition, but the fervour with which all nations embraced the idea soon made it manifest that
no permanent edifice could contain more than a small fraction of the exhibits. There was no time
to be lost&mdash;the 1st of May 1851 had been fixed for the opening ceremony.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Competing Designs.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The difficulty was not the
cost, for a guarantee fund of £200,000 had been speedily subscribed; but the designs and specifications
had to be submitted, the materials prepared, and the erection completed, all within
the space of nine months. A site in Hyde Park was chosen, and the Commissioners
set to work to examine no fewer than 245 designs and specifications sent in by architects all
over the world.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Mr. Paxton&rsquo;s selected.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
They had almost decided in favour of a design by a French architect, when a
certain Mr. Joseph Paxton&mdash;not a professional architect, but superintendent of the Duke of Devonshire&rsquo;s
gardens at Chatsworth&mdash;produced a scheme so original and simple that it was
adopted at once in preference to all others. It was an enormous conservatory
of glass and iron&mdash;1,848 feet long, 408 feet broad, and 66 feet high&mdash;with transepts constructed so as
to contain some of the elms still growing in Hyde Park. The decision of the Commissioners was
not arrived at till July 26: not a single casting or piece of material had been prepared yet; but the
contractors, Messrs. Fox, Henderson &amp; Co., undertook to deliver the building ready for painting and
fitting on December 31.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Erection of the Crystal Palace.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The ground lying between Albert Gate and Knightsbridge Barracks on

over to them on July 30; the first column was raised on September 26, and
on the stipulated day Messrs. Fox and Henderson handed over the structure of
the Crystal Palace, as it was called, to the Commissioners. Though the great
fabric vanished with the leaves of a single summer, yet this achievement of the contractors deserves
record among the most famous exploits of industrial enterprise, affording, as it did, a practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
illustration of the dominant object of the Great Exhibition, as Prince Albert had defined it in his
speech at the Mansion House; namely, &ldquo;To give us a true test and living picture of the point of
development at which the whole of mankind has arrived ... a new starting point from which all
nations will be able to direct their further exertions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were <i>frondeurs</i>, of course, as there always are in the projection of any scheme involving
novelty; and the <i>Times</i> lent its sonorous voice to swell the clamour raised against the desecration of
Hyde Park by the introduction of a commercial speculation. It may appear to some that the
British retain to this day some traces of insular prejudice against foreigners, but such a feeling was
far more prevalent in 1850 than one is apt to realise now.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Colonel Sibthorp denounces the Scheme.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
It found fitting expression in the House
of Commons from the lips of Colonel Sibthorp, who declared that &ldquo;when Free
Trade had left nothing else wanting to complete the ruin of the Empire, the
devil had suggested the idea of the Great Exhibition, so that the foreigners who
had first robbed us of our trade might now be enabled to rob us of our honour.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D"></a><a href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a>
The circumstances of the moment secured the gallant Colonel more sympathy than his grotesque
speech and exaggerated fears would otherwise have won for him. The Protestant spirit of England
had taken alarm at a Papal bull re-establishing in Great Britain a hierarchy of bishops deriving
titles from the sees to which they were appointed.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Papal Titles in Great Britain.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This might have seemed a
higher compliment to Great Britain than the arrangement under which the Roman
Catholic bishops, which had existed ever since the Reformation, held their appointments,
under fictitious titles in <i>partibus infidelium</i>. But a good deal had occurred in recent years to
arouse Protestant jealousy of Papal aggression. The Tractarian movement had resulted in the
secession of Newman, Manning, and other conspicuous clergy and laymen to the Church of Rome;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
people both in London and Rome had begun to prognosticate a general secession from the Church of
England, and there was something peculiarly startling in the appointment at this juncture of Cardinal
Wiseman as Archbishop of Westminster.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Popular Indignation.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Most Englishmen greatly preferred that the Pope should
continue to regard and call them &ldquo;infidels,&rdquo; than that
he should be permitted to bring them under his immediate
patronage in this formal and
ostentatious manner; and the feeling
of irritation was intensified by Wiseman&rsquo;s pastoral
letter to the English people on October 7, 1850, in
which the new Archbishop announced that &ldquo;your
beloved country has received a place among the fair
churches which, normally constituted, form the splendid
aggregate of Catholic communion.&rdquo; Either the Protestant
Reformation, for which Great Britain had paid
so heavy a price, was a precious reality, in which
case, so it appeared to most Englishmen, this was an
insolent and significant aggression by the Court of
Rome, or it was an obsolete blunder, and Rome was
going to forgive it and resume her spiritual sway over
our people.</p>

AND THEN RAN AWAY.</p>

<p>Lord John Russell&rsquo;s Ecclesiastical Titles Bill of February was
materially modified and made much less stringent before it was reintroduced
in March.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Prime Minister lost no time in showing how
the affair presented itself to his mind.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Ecclesiastical Titles Bill.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Within less than a month he had proclaimed that the Pope&rsquo;s
action was &ldquo;a pretension of supremacy over the realm of England, and a claim
to sole and undivided sway, which is inconsistent with the Queen&rsquo;s supremacy,
with the rights of our bishops and clergy, and with the spiritual independence
of the nation as asserted even in Roman Catholic times&rdquo;; and he vindicated the sincerity of these
expressions by introducing, immediately after the meeting of Parliament
in February 1851, a Bill to prevent the assumption by Roman
Catholics of titles taken from any place within the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">THOMAS CARLYLE,<br />1795&ndash;1881.</p>

<p>The son of a stonemason; born at Ecclefechan,
Dumfries, and educated at Edinburgh
University. His essays and historical writings,
set forth in virile and rugged English, have had
a very great influence on literature and on
popular thought, both in England and America.
&ldquo;Sartor Resartus&rdquo; appeared in 1833&ndash;4; the
&ldquo;French Revolution&rdquo; in 1837; &ldquo;Cromwell&rsquo;s
Letters and Speeches&rdquo; in 1847; &ldquo;Frederick the
Great&rdquo; in 1858&ndash;65.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was a hazardous measure to steer through the Imperial
Parliament. Outside popular passion was aflame; effigies of the Pope
and Wiseman, sixteen feet high, had been dragged through the
streets of London on the Fifth of November instead of the usual
Guy Faux. On the other hand, both the Radicals and the Irish
Catholics in the House might be counted on to offer fiercest opposition
to the Bill. Ministers themselves dreaded enacting anything
that savoured of religious intolerance, and the Queen herself has left
on record her feelings about the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would never have consented,&rdquo; she wrote to the Duchess of
Gloucester, &ldquo;to anything which breathed a spirit of intolerance.
Sincerely Protestant as I have always been, and always shall be,
and indignant as I am at those who call themselves Protestants
while they are, in fact, quite the contrary, I much regret the unchristian
and intolerant spirit exhibited by many people at the
public meetings. I cannot bear to hear the violent abuse of the
Catholic religion, which is so painful and so cruel towards the many
good and innocent Roman Catholics. However, we must hope and
trust this excitement will soon cease, and that the wholesome effect
of it upon our own Church will be lasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No wiser words have ever been written or spoken by a monarch. It was both necessary and
desirable to give effect to the national repugnance to spiritual interference; but it was imperative that
spiritual freedom should be left absolutely unfettered. The progress of the measure through the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
of Commons was like that of Samson&rsquo;s foxes through the Philistines&rsquo; corn; it kindled every slumbering
sentiment of acrimony and hatred. The Radicals, through Mr. Roebuck, exclaimed against it as
&ldquo;one of the meanest, pettiest, and most futile measures that ever disgraced even bigotry itself.&rdquo; The
Irish employed all their inexhaustible resources in resistance; nor was their opposition modified in
the least degree by the Government agreeing to exclude Ireland from the Bill. Nevertheless, after
four nights&rsquo; debate on the motion for leave to introduce the Bill, the division list showed a majority
of 332 in favour of it.</p>

<p>But just as Peel fell on the morrow of his great victory on the Corn Laws, so within a week of
the division on the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill Russell encountered defeat in resisting a motion to extend
the Franchise. He resigned office: the Queen sent for Lord Stanley, who recommended that an
attempt should be made by Russell to form a coalition Cabinet with the help of
the party of the late Robert Peel.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Defeat of Ministers on the Question of the Franchise.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But the recent debate had raised implacable
bitterness between the Peelites and the Whigs. Next, Lord Aberdeen
refused to attempt the formation of a Ministry, on the ground that no Ministry
could stand which would not undertake to deal with Papal aggression, which he was determined
not to do. Lord Stanley then reluctantly tried his hand and failed. The situation was more
embarrassing than any that had arisen since 1812, when the Lords Wellesley, Moira, Grey, and
Grenville had successively failed to form a Cabinet. The deadlock brought about a touching incident.
Her Majesty resolved to ask the advice of her well-tried servant, the Duke of Wellington, then in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
his eighty-third year. He gave it in terms as concise as one of his own general orders: &ldquo;That
the party still filling the offices, till Her Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure shall be declared, is the one best
calculated to carry on the Government at the present moment.&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Lord Russell Resumes.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
On March 3, therefore, Lord John Russell, on Her Majesty&rsquo;s invitation, returned to office.
The Ecclesiastical Titles Bill was resumed, but the more stringent clauses were
withdrawn, and in the form in which it finally received the Royal Assent it did no more than
declare the illegality of the English titles assumed by the Roman Catholic hierarchy.<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E"></a><a href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a></p>

<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Opening of the Great Exhibition.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But all hostile criticism was reduced, first to whispers, by the marvellous
success of the structure itself, and then to silence, by the splendour of the opening
ceremony and of the display within the building.
It is the poet&rsquo;s gift to store the
essence of events in very small phials, and Thackeray&rsquo;s <i>May Day Ode</i> vividly reflects
the feelings of the nation on that far-off spring morning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">&ldquo;But yesterday a naked sod,</div>
<div class="line">The dandies sneered from Rotten Row,</div>

<div class="line">A blazing arch of lucid glass</div>
<div class="line">Leaps like a fountain from the grass</div>

</div></div>

<p>A generation has sprung up since that day, satiated with marvels and surprised by no achievement
of hand and brain. But no such visible, tangible accomplishment in the arts of peace had ever been
manifested up to that time; if Prince Albert&rsquo;s idea had been one of startling novelty, the celerity of
its realisation was still more startling.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">THE WHITE STAR LINE R.M.S. &ldquo;TEUTONIC&rdquo; AS AN ARMED CRUISER AT
THE NAVAL REVIEW, August 4, 1889.</p>

<p>Addressing the members of the Institute of Naval Architects on March 30, 1887, upon the
&ldquo;Merchant Service and the Royal Navy,&rdquo; Sir N. Barnaby, late Director of Naval Construction,
referred to the arrangements which had then recently been completed between the Admiralty and
the White Star and other Companies for the retention of their steamers for war purposes, and pointed
out that &ldquo;this seed, for which we have to thank Mr. Ismay, was planted at the Admiralty nine
years ago; ... the outcome of proposals made by Mr. Ismay as far back as 1878,&rdquo; when he urged
upon the attention of the Admiralty that a fast mail or passenger steamer might be as efficient a
factor in a naval war as an ordinary war cruiser, and offered to make an agreement to hold at the
disposal of the Admiralty, upon terms then specified, certain ships for the purposes of the State in
time of war.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>More than mere womanly emotion, this, in presence of an exciting scene. The May Day poet put
on it the same interpretation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">&ldquo;Swell, organ, swell your trumpet blast!</div>
<div class="line">March, Queen and Royal pageant, march</div>

<div class="line">God&rsquo;s peaceful sun is beaming through,</div>
<div class="indent4">And shining over all.&rdquo;</div>
</div></div>

<p>One note of discord, and one only,
was heard; rather, one note necessary
to make the complete harmony was
silent. It would have fulfilled the international
character of the Exhibition
and emphasised it as an echo of the
message of peace on earth and goodwill
towards men had the Corps Diplomatique
availed themselves of Prince
Albert&rsquo;s invitation to present an address
to the Queen. But, strangely as it may
sound at the present day, most of the
great Continental rulers held severely
aloof from the whole project of the
Exhibition. They were apprehensive of
the effect which contact with English
institutions, so dangerously liberal, might
have on their own subjects, and the
foreign Ambassadors agreed, by a majority
of three, to decline to present an
address.</p>

<p>The success of the opening ceremony
attended the Exhibition to its close on
October 15.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Its Success and Close.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Between six and seven
millions of persons
visited it, and the
surplus funds accruing
to the Commissioners, amounting to
upwards of £200,000, were afterwards
applied, on Prince Albert&rsquo;s suggestion,
to the purchase of the South Kensington
estate, now occupied by various institutions
for the encouragement of Science
and Art.</p>

<p>As inaugurating an era of universal peace, which its most enthusiastic supporters expected it to do,
the Great Exhibition of 1851 proved a failure; but as a means of diffusing among the people of Great
Britain views about foreigners more enlightened than those they entertained before, as an impetus to
commerce and manufacture and a stimulus to artistic production, the &ldquo;Crystal Palace&rdquo; has fully
fulfilled the most sanguine anticipation.</p>

<span class="sidenote clearleft"><span class="hidev">|</span>Louis Napoleon&rsquo;s Coup d&rsquo;État.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
spirits had hailed in it, was rudely shattered by events in France.
The <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> whereby Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte seized
on the government of the country and suspended the Constitution
took place on the morning of December 2. This event concerns the present narrative only in one
respect. When the news came to England it caused an almost unanimous feeling of horror at the
massacre of peaceful citizens. The Queen, who was at Osborne, was informed on December 4 of what
had taken place, and at once wrote to the Prime Minister, enjoining on him the necessity &ldquo;that Lord
Normanby (her Ambassador at Paris) should be instructed to remain entirely passive, and should
take no part whatever in what is passing.&rdquo; These instructions were conveyed to Lord Normanby
next day by the Foreign Minister, Lord Palmerston. But, in a despatch written by Lord Normanby
to Lord Palmerston on December 6, informing him that he had made known to M. Turgot, the
French Foreign Minister, that he had received Her Majesty&rsquo;s commands to make no change in his
relations with the French Government in consequence of what had passed, the following startling
passage occurred:&mdash;&ldquo;Monsieur Turgot said that ... he had two days since heard from M. Walewski
(French Ambassador in London) that your lordship had expressed to him your entire approbation of
the act of the President, and the conviction that he could not have acted otherwise than he had done.&rdquo;</p>

On reading a statement attributed to her Foreign Minister
so far at variance with her own opinion and the decision of
her Cabinet, the Queen wrote to Lord
John Russell, asking him if &ldquo;he knew anything
about the alleged approval, which, if
true, would again expose the honour and dignity of the Queen&rsquo;s
Government in the eyes of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, the most formidable line-of battle ship afloat at the

120 guns. She was the Flag ship at Portsmouth from 1835 to
1840. In 1850 she was converted into a Training Ship, and
was finally broken up in 1869. The Silver Model, from which
this Illustration was photographed, was presented to Her Majesty
the Queen, together with a similar one of the ill-fated <i>Victoria</i>&mdash;the
typical ship of 1887&mdash;by the officers and men of the
Royal Navy, Royal Marines, and Auxiliary Naval Forces, and
was exhibited amongst the Jubilee Presents.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;again&rdquo; used by the Queen in this letter had
reference to Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s action in regard to the visit of
Kossuth, the Hungarian refugee, to England in the previous
October. There had been much sympathy in England with
the cause of Hungarian independence; Kossuth had been
fêted in many towns as an illustrious patriot and exile, and
Palmerston consented to receive a visit from him. This was
more than the susceptibilities of the Austrian Government
could endure; Russell having summoned a Cabinet Council to
consider the intended reception by the Foreign Minister,
Palmerston reluctantly yielded to the opinion of his colleagues,
and the reception was given up. But he consoled himself
by receiving at the Foreign Office addresses from Radical
meetings, in which the Emperors of Russia and Austria were
described as &ldquo;odious and detestable assassins&rdquo; and &ldquo;merciless tyrants and despots&rdquo;; and, in expressing
himself &ldquo;extremely flattered and
highly gratified&rdquo; at the terms directed
towards himself, he added that &ldquo;it
could not be expected that he should
concur in some of the expressions which
had been used in the addresses.&rdquo; It
was in receiving the deputation conveying
these addresses that this characteristically
English Minister earned one of
his most-enduring nicknames. He said
in the course of his speech that the
conduct of Foreign Affairs required &ldquo;a
great deal of good generalship and judgment,
and during the pending struggle a
good deal of judicious bottle-holding was
obliged to be brought into play.&rdquo; However
much this allusion to the prize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
ring may have scandalised some of the &ldquo;unco guid,&rdquo; it was just one of those sayings that tickle the
popular fancy, and the &ldquo;Judicious Bottle-holder&rdquo; furnished the subject of one of <i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> lively cartoons.</p>

<p>The <i>Victoria</i> was built in 1887 by Sir W. G. Armstrong, Mitchell. &amp; Co., and was one of
three &ldquo;first-class armourclads&rdquo; which were armed with 110-ton guns&mdash;the heaviest ordnance
ever made. She was of steel, 10,500 tons displacement. The loss of this magnificent ship, with
the Admiral, 30 officers, and 320 men out of a crew of 600, on the 22nd June 1893, through
colliding with H.M.S. <i>Camperdown</i> while executing man&oelig;uvres off the Syrian coast, is one
of the most tragic events in recent history.</p>

</div>

<p>But it was necessary to put a check on the
Foreign Secretary&rsquo;s recklessness. It was intimated
to him that his conduct was calculated
to place the Sovereign in a most painful position
towards her allies, and this rebuke, Russell wrote
to the Queen, it was hoped would &ldquo;have its
effect on Lord Palmerston.&rdquo; This incident
closed on December 4, only two days after
the French <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i>, and when it became
apparent that the Foreign Secretary had perpetrated
a further indiscretion, strong measures
had to be taken. The dismissal of a
Minister is an extreme exertion of the
Royal Prerogative, though it is one that
was not uncommon in former reigns.
Nevertheless, it is the only expedient
when a Minister refuses to carry out
the policy of the Queen&rsquo;s Government
or enters upon an independent one of
his own.</p>

<p>After some correspondence between
Russell and Palmerston,
the former wrote,
on December 17, informing
Palmerston &ldquo;that the conduct of Foreign Affairs could no longer be left in his hands with
advantage to the country,&rdquo; and offering
him the Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Dismissal of Palmerston.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>Of course Lord Palmerston resigned,

<p>In this year (1852) the Houses of
Lords and Commons took possession
of the new Palace of Westminster, built
from the design of Barry on the site of
the old Palace, destroyed by fire in 1835.
The style of architecture selected&mdash;the
Tudor-Gothic&mdash;is not one which lends
itself readily to grand or massive treatment,
owing to the infinite repetition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
of detailed ornament; but it has this to recommend it, that it is exclusively indigenous to England,
and the architect was successful in erecting on a very unpromising site a crowning example of that
particular form of Gothic building.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The New Houses of Parliament.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The cost of the new Palace as it stands
amounted to about £3,000,000; but it should be said that Barry&rsquo;s design has never
been completed. It was intended to extend the buildings to form a quadrangle
round the court at the foot of the Clock Tower, to accommodate various Public Departments now
housed in Whitehall and Downing Street.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The political convulsions in France were mildly reflected in Great Britain during the year 1852&mdash;the
year of three Administrations. In the first-named country, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, Prince-President
of the Republic which he had turned into a farce, had secured the good will of the Army
by restoring to them their Napoleonic Eagles, and then, with the whole armed force of the nation at
his back, had issued an appeal to the people in the form of a plebiscite. By 7,824,189 votes to
253,145 they had bestowed on him the title and dignity of Emperor Napoleon III. Such an appeal
and such a response could only be interpreted as the resurrection of the Napoleonic idea.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>French Invasion Apprehended.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In the forefront of the policy of the new Emperor must surely be found vengeance for
Waterloo and the humiliation of England. If this was not expressed in so many
words, there were frequent passages in the speeches of Louis Napoleon which
could bear no other interpretation. England awoke to her danger; the &ldquo;nation of shopkeepers&rdquo; did
not wait for legislative measures, but quietly began arming and drilling, encouraged by the authorities,
thus laying the foundation of that splendid defensive force of artillery and infantry of which the
Volunteers are composed at this day. Great Britain possessed in 1852 a small army&mdash;about 24,000
infantry at home&mdash;absolutely without any reserve force. The Cabinet devised a scheme for creating
a local Militia, to be drilled for fourteen days in each year, and to serve exclusively within their own counties.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Resignation of Ministers.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Prince Albert saw grave defects in the plan, and the Duke of Wellington
liked it even less than he did; nevertheless Lord John Russell introduced his
Bill to give effect to it. Then came Palmerston&rsquo;s opportunity. He was a free
agent now, and rendered good service in opposing an inadequate and almost wholly useless measure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
On his motion the Government were defeated by eleven votes on February 20, and next day the
resignation of Ministers was in the hands of the Queen. The Earl of Derby (the irreconcilable
Lord Stanley of Peel&rsquo;s Cabinet) undertook to form a Ministry, which, inasmuch as it could only
be drawn from Protectionist ranks, was in a hopeless minority in the House of Commons. Lord
Malmesbury took the seals of the Foreign Office, and Mr. Disraeli became, <i>per saltum</i>, Chancellor of
the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons&mdash;an instance unique in recent times of such
a position being assumed by one who had never before held office.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The &ldquo;Who? Who?&rdquo; Cabinet.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The rest of the Cabinet was
made up of men then untried and unknown, though some of them afterwards rose to distinction, and
got the name of the &ldquo;Who? Who?&rdquo; Ministry.
The origin of the nickname was a
conversation overheard in the House of Lords between the Prime Minister and
the Duke of Wellington, who was eagerly questioning Lord Derby about the
composition of his new Cabinet. The old Duke had grown very deaf, and all his inquiries were
plainly audible to the House, as well, of course, as the Premier&rsquo;s replies. &ldquo;Who? Who?&rdquo; asked the
old Duke, as, hand to ear, he strove to identify the unfamiliar names, and &ldquo;Who? Who?&rdquo;
became the title of the new Government. Weak as it was, however, and holding office as it did on
sufferance only, the Derby Ministry was able to prepare and carry a Militia Bill which satisfied even
so critical an expert as the Iron Duke himself.</p>

<p>Brief as was the duration of the Derby Ministry it outlived the days of one of its warmest

<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Death of the Duke of Wellington.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
To say that he was the most popular individual in the United Kingdom would
be to apply a term which perhaps, of all others, he would have relished least;
but without doubt &ldquo;the Duke&rdquo; was the best beloved. The first soldier in Europe,
thirty-seven years of peace had not dimmed the lustre of his great renown in war, nor prevailed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
make the nation forget his services in the hour of England&rsquo;s greatest need. If, as a statesman, he
could not command the same unanimous meed of &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; he had established a standard of
public life too often obscured in the heat of party strife. Vittoria, Salamanca, Talavera, Waterloo&mdash;the
radiance from those far off conflagrations still glowed round that venerable head, but it was the
honest purpose, bluntly spoken and fearlessly acted on, that
won for Wellington a place in the hearts of his countrymen
far more enduring than the reward of any commander, however
successful&mdash;of any orator, however powerful.</p>

<p>There was the precedent of the obsequies of Nelson to
justify the Queen in commanding a funeral of the Great Duke
at the public expense; but Her Majesty was desirous to
associate her people with herself in doing honour to the
memory of her greatest subject. The body of the Duke,
therefore, was put in charge of a guard of honour till the
meeting of Parliament in November, when the consent of
both Houses was immediately given to a funeral at the public
expense and the interment of Wellington in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral,
beside the
tomb of Nelson.
All the Great
Powers of Europe,
save one, sent
representatives to
the ceremony. It
would have caused
no surprise had
France, with a Napoleon once more in supreme power,
refused to allow her Ambassador to attend the funeral of
her ancient foe, but Louis Napoleon told Count Walewski
he wished to forget the past and to continue on the
best of terms with England. It was not France, but
Austria, who was conspicuous by the absence of her
Ambassador from St. Paul&rsquo;s on this November day; and
the reason was found in an extraordinary circumstance
which had occurred a few weeks previously.

An Austrian
notable, General Haynau,
arrived in England
early in
September, on an
unofficial visit. He had earned
an unenviable reputation for
cruelty in putting down insurrections
in Italy and Hungary;
ugly stories had been circulated
about the flogging of Hungarian
women and other barbarities,
enough, whether true or not,
to make his name detested
by all who sympathised with the national movement on the Continent. One day he went to
inspect Barclay&rsquo;s brewery, and as soon as his identity with the &ldquo;Austrian butcher&rdquo; became known
to the workmen there, they rushed at him with loud cries, pelted him, tore his coat and tried to
cut off his long moustaches. Escaping from the brewery, he was assailed with equal fury in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
street, and had to take refuge in a public house till
the police came to his assistance. The Austrian Chargé
d&rsquo;Affaires appealed for redress, and Lord Palmerston
called in person to express the deep regret of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Government at the outrage.</p>

Naval Authorities as of doubtful practical value; but it soon became
necessary for them to adopt the principle of defensive armour for our
own ships. The <i>Warrior</i>, built by private contract at a cost of
£376,000, was completed in October, 1861. She has a length of

followed is memorable as the occasion of the first encounter between two men who, for a quarter of

and Fox had been at the beginning of the century. Disraeli&mdash;by this time fully conscious, and
embittered by the consciousness, that he was fighting for a losing cause&mdash;concluded a speech full of
stinging invective at two o&rsquo;clock on the morning of December 11. To answer him rose one whom
Macaulay had described in 1838 as &ldquo;the rising hope of those stern and unbending Tories who
follow reluctantly and mutinously a leader (Peel) whose experience is indispensable to them, but whose
cautious temper and moderate opinions they abhor.&rdquo; Mr. Gladstone had been a Member of Parliament

<p>Before entering upon a review of the events
which brought to a violent close the peace
which Great Britain had maintained for thirty-nine
years with the other European Powers,
the present seems a fitting place to give a
sketch of salient points in the expansion of
British Colonies in various parts of the world&mdash;Colonies
which, for the
greater part, had no existence
before Queen Victoria
came to the throne.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Expansion of British Colonies.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
It was in 1858 that the
discoveries of gold in British territory, as well
as in California, had begun to fill the channels
of trade and enrich the manufacturers of the
home country in a degree beyond all previous
experience. The great Continent of Australia,
discovered by Captain Cook in 1770 and by
him named New South Wales, was hardly
known to people in England during the first
forty years of the present century except as a penal settlement, although a number of British
emigrants found their way there when the Army and Navy were reduced after the long European
wars had come to an end in 1815. But it was not until the gold-fields were discovered in 1851 that
the full tide of immigration set in. The growth and development of the European community since
that time have been immense. From the original settlement at Botany Bay in 1788 have arisen the
States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Western Australia, each with
its separate representative constitution and legislature, and a governor appointed by the Queen. The
population, rapidly increasing, already amounts to three millions and a quarter, with an annual
export trade of more than £70,000,000. The gold-fields, since their discovery in 1851, have added
about £300,000,000 to the wealth of the
world, nor is there any near prospect of
the supply failing. On the contrary,
the newly-opened mines at Coolgardie,
in Western Australia, promise to prove
the richest field in the whole island.</p>

</div>

<p>New Zealand was first colonised in
1839, though Europeans had settled there
as far back as 1814, and in 1841 it was
created by letters patent a colony distinct
from New South Wales. The chief
wealth of this island is pastoral and
agricultural, though New Zealand contributes
also to the Pactolus flowing
north, having exported gold to the value
of more than a million sterling in 1895.</p>

<p>Tasmania, formerly Van Diemen&rsquo;s
Land, is another insular possession of
Great Britain in the South Pacific,
originally occupied in 1803 as a penal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
settlement; and the Australasian Dominions of the Crown were completed by the annexation of
the Fiji group of islands in 1874, and British New Guinea in 1888. This vast territory, with its
almost inexhaustible mineral wealth and fertility, may be said with almost literal accuracy to be the
peculiar creation of the reign of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>In 1853 an important change in the penal code of Great Britain was effected by the Act altering
the punishment of transportation of convicts into that of penal servitude.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Repeal of the Transportation Act.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Lord Chancellor
admitted, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, that transportation answered
the end of punishment better than anything else which could be devised; it
was the strongest deterrent, short of a capital sentence, which could be employed
without the infliction of physical pain, and, had the United Kingdom only been concerned, no
alteration in the law would have been proposed. But the interests of the Colonies must be taken
into account also; the strong representations laid before the Government by the Colonists, coupled
with the extraordinary discoveries of gold in Australia, made it imperative that these growing
communities should cease to be the slumping ground for the refuse of British civilisation, and
other provision must be made for the disposal of criminals. The measure became law, and the
Australasian settlements, relieved from the slur which had become wellnigh intolerable, entered on
a career of expansion and profitable industry of which no man can yet foretell the ultimate result.</p>

<p>Besides British India, of which the growth and consolidation is described elsewhere, the chief
expansion of the Empire and its protectorate during the present reign has taken place in South
Africa. The Cape Colony was ceded to the British Crown in 1814; the Colony of Natal was
added to it in 1843, was erected into a separate Colony in 1856, and was made self-governing in 1893.
Basutoland was annexed to the Cape Colony in 1871, but in 1884 it was constituted a separate
Crown Colony, and neither it nor Bechuanaland, which, having been annexed in 1885, is governed
from the Cape, have yet developed representative institutions.</p>

problem which has never presented itself in Australasia. There the aboriginal population has died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
out everywhere, except in New Zealand, from the mere contact with civilisation, and, except in the
Island of New Guinea of which the Germans possess a moiety, British influence is not hampered
by any competing European race. But it is far otherwise in South Africa. There, also, what may be
regarded as the aboriginal races, the Hottentots and Bushmen, have been crushed wellnigh out of
existence, but they have been replaced
on the one hand by the powerful Bantu
people, consisting of Kaffirs, Zulus,
Bechuanas, and other Negroid tribes,
and on the other by the Boers, descended
from Dutch settlers of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
The Administration of South Africa
has to provide for the development
of British enterprise and to secure
peaceful relations between the diverse
elements of the population. It cannot
be doubted that South Africa contains
the material of enormous wealth. The
climate of the high veldt, a wide belt
of land ranging between 4,000 and
5,000 feet above sea-level, is exceedingly
salubrious. Diamonds and gold
already have been worked in large quantities,
though a few years ago their
very existence was unsuspected. At the present time the yield of gold is equal to that of either
Australia or America, amounting to one-fifth of the total annual output of the world. Should the
gold ever be worked out there is abundant mineral wealth of other kinds, including an almost virgin
coal-field, covering an area of nearly a thousand square miles between Pretoria and Delagoa Bay.</p>

<p>In America, the most notable feature in the recent history of the British possessions is found
in the growth of wealth
and population in the
Dominion of Canada. It
has been shown how
that Colony rose in rebellion
in the first year
of the present reign, and
how Lord Durham framed
a Constitution for it in
his report. Lord Durham
died, and his scheme lay
in a pigeon-hole of the
Colonial Office till 1867,
when it was virtually
carried into effect by
Lord Carnarvon&rsquo;s Act
for the Confederation of
the British North American
Provinces. Upper and Lower Canada, the English and French territories of the rebellion,
are now known as the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and with them are confederated New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, British Columbia, Manitoba, and the North-West
Territories. The population of Canada has risen from about one million and a half in 1841 to five
millions at the present day, and progress in commerce and wealth has been equally rapid.</p>

British Minister at St. Petersburg, Sir George Hamilton Seymour, supplied a
phrase which has become historic, and remains as appropriate to the present state of Turkey-in-Europe
as it was forty-four years ago. The Ottoman Empire in Europe had become an anachronism, not
because it was a heritage won by mediæval conquest, for that may be assigned as the origin of almost
every European State, but because the Turk maintained his rule in modern times by mediæval
methods. In the days when nations were kept in subjection by the violence of their governors, the
Turk had been a standing menace to all Europe, for he was as powerful as any Christian
Monarch; but in proportion as the other nationalities acquired the solidarity which follows on the
growth of constitutional rights and the limitation of absolute rule, he became a terror only to the
subject races within the Ottoman dominions. To the rising tide of Western civilisation he opposed
the breastwork of philosophic indifference, though the ancient Saracen instinct for war still caused him
to adopt eagerly the successive inventions in military armament. The weakest principality had nothing
to fear in the nineteenth century from Turkish invasion, but the most powerful states had realised
that it would be a formidable task to make the Porte comply with the concert of Europe&mdash;such is
the quality of genuine <i>vis inertiæ</i>. Nevertheless the real guarantee for the integrity of the Ottoman
Empire had come to be&mdash;not her army and fleet, nor the fervour of her Moslem subjects&mdash;but the
mutual jealousy and suspicion existing between other Powers regarding the disposal of Ottoman
territory. It had come to this, then, that the Christian states acquiesced in the continuance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Ottoman Empire in Europe as a kind of buffer state&mdash;a barrier against such a collision of interests
and ambitions as might revive warfare on a Napoleonic scale. The heirs of the &ldquo;sick man&rdquo; dreaded
his death because of the conflict sure to ensue
among his heirs.</p>

used in the trenches at Sebastopol, and had its trunnions shot away.</p>

<p>Three European Great Powers were more
closely affected than others by the Eastern
question&mdash;Russia, by reason of her office as
guardian of the Eastern Church, as well as by
her hereditary policy of absorbing neighbouring
territories&mdash;Austria, on account of her claim
to the Danubian provinces of the Porte&mdash;and
England, because she could not suffer the
advance of Russia between her and her Asiatic
dominions. The interest of England may seem
to have been less direct than that of the other
Powers; nevertheless, the continual encroachment
of Russia in Asia, and the steady extension
of the Russian frontier towards that of
British North-West India, had so powerfully
impressed British statesmen with the danger of
a collision in that quarter, that the integrity of the Ottoman Empire had become a cardinal principle
in the Continental diplomacy of England.</p>

<p>The huge 110-ton guns of Sir W. G. Armstrong, Mitchell, &amp; Co. are mounted in the <i>Sanspareil</i>

considerable disadvantages attaching to the use of artillery so enormous, as will be understood when
it is stated that the cost of each round fired with full charge and armour-piercing projectile is £200;
that the gun would become practically useless after firing 75 rounds of this description (of course a
much smaller charge is used when practising); and that the energy developed amounts to 60,000
foot-tons&mdash;about enough to lift the whole ship six feet in the air. For these and other reasons the
67-ton gun shown on next page is now being supplied in preference to the larger one. The 110 ton
gun is capable of piercing a solid mass of wrought iron 30½ inches thick, at a distance of 1,000
yards; the much smaller 9·2-inch (22-ton) gun was tested in 1887, and threw a shot nearly 12 miles,
its trajectory rising to a height greater, by 2,000 feet, than that of Mont Blanc.</p>

<p>But the Emperor Nicholas of Russia had convinced himself that the &ldquo;sick man&rdquo; was at the point
of death, and that it was essential to the peace of Europe that his heirs should divide the inheritance
before his demise.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Projects of the Emperor Nicholas.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The sentence at the head of this chapter was spoken by the
Czar when he revived proposals which he had made to the Duke of Wellington
and Lord Aberdeen, then Foreign Secretary, on the occasion of his visit to
England in 1844. These proposals had been embodied in a celebrated memorandum drawn up by
Count Nesselrode, to the effect that the Turkish Empire should be maintained in its integrity as long
as possible, but that as soon as its fall could be averted no longer, England, Austria, and Russia
should act on a common understanding and divide the dominion among themselves. Nesselrode&rsquo;s
memorandum had been received and placed in the archives of the Foreign Office, and no disclaimer
of assent to the propositions therein
had ever been made on the part of
Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government. Silence is
often assumed to indicate consent, so
when Nicholas, believing in 1853 that
the Porte was indeed on the point of
dissolution, renewed his proposal for a
partition of the Turkish Empire, it was
at least excusable that he should reckon
on the co-operation of Great Britain.
Lord Aberdeen, who had been Foreign
Secretary when the Czar was in England
in 1844, was Prime Minister in
1853. Nicholas disclaimed any intention
of a Russian occupation of Constantinople;
he suggested that Bulgaria and
Servia might be constituted independent
States under Russian protection, and
declared that he would acquiesce in the
annexation of Egypt and Candia by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Great Britain. All this, and much more, he explained to Sir Hamilton Seymour, assuring him that if
Great Britain and Russia came to an understanding on the subject, it mattered nothing to him how
the other Powers might view it.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Russia, disappointed in his overtures to England,
endeavoured to obtain the assistance of Austria against Turkey.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this juncture a fresh controversy was stirred in
connection with Ottoman rule.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Custody of the Holy Places.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In the sixteenth century
a treaty was concluded between the Sultan and François I.,
King of France, whereby the custody
of the Holy Places in Palestine had
been committed to the monks of the
Latin Church, who were placed under the protection of
the Crown of France. Subsequently firmans had been
granted to the Greek Church, conferring rights at variance
with the exclusive guardianship claimed by the Latin
Church. Incessant disputes arose on a ludicrously minute
point, such as might have puzzled diplomatists in the era
of the Crusades, but one which seemed strangely out of
keeping with statesmanship of the nineteenth century,
namely, &ldquo;whether, for the purpose of passing through the
building into their grotto, the Latin monks should have the
key of the chief door of the Church of Bethlehem, and
also one of the keys of each of the two doors of the Sacred Manger, and whether they should be
at liberty to place in the Sanctuary of the Nativity a silver star adorned with the arms of France.&rdquo;
The French Republic, and afterwards the French Empire, as heirs of the Crown of France, championed
the cause of the Latin monks, even threatening to occupy Jerusalem; until, in February 1853, the
Porte issued a firman in order to reconcile in a reasonable way the conflicting claims of the two
Churches. But reason was the last influence to prevail in an unreasonable quarrel.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Prince Menschikoff&rsquo;s Demand.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Russian forces, before the issue of the firman, had already begun massing on the frontiers
of Moldavia, and immediately after the issue of the firman, Prince Menschikoff
arrived at Constantinople with a numerous military suite, endeavoured to force
on the Porte an agreement establishing a Russian protectorate of Christians within Turkish Dominions,
and threatened a rupture of diplomatic
relations unless this was agreed to at
once. Reschid Pasha asked for a delay
of five or six days to consider such a
momentous question; it was refused;
whereupon the Ottoman Council promptly
declined to become a party to the proposed
convention. Menschikoff immediately
left Constantinople; the Russian
Government continued warlike preparations,
which were met by similar measures
on the part of the Porte, as a
simple measure of self-defence.</p>

<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Russian Invasion and The Vienna Note.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Of course this was an
act of war, but no collision actually took
place, and representatives of the four
Great Powers&mdash;Austria, France, Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Britain, and Prussia&mdash;met at Vienna in July and agreed on a Note embodying terms for the peaceful
settlement of the dispute. It were natural to expect that a document of such moment should have
been framed in language of the utmost precision and incapable of bearing ambiguous interpretation.
Nevertheless this short Note contained five passages so vague and ambiguous that they might have
been construed into giving away the whole case of Turkey, though this was undoubtedly far from
the intention of the authors. Russia, perceiving her advantage, accepted the Note at once; but the
Ministers of the Sultan declined to do so, unless the five objectionable passages were modified.
Nesselrode stated explicitly the reasons which prevented Russia from agreeing to any modification.
These reasons enlightened the British Cabinet for the first time as to the construction put on the
Note by Russia, which was directly contrary to that intended by the Four Powers.</p>

<p>England, therefore, was compelled to acquiesce in Turkey&rsquo;s refusal to sign the Note, at the
same time urging her not to regard the occupation of Moldavia and Wallachia as an act of war.
The state of affairs towards the end of September is concisely described in a note written by
Prince Albert to Baron Stockmar: &ldquo;Meyendorff is in the Vienna Cabinet; Louis Napoleon wishes
for peace, enjoyment, and cheap corn; the King of Prussia is a reed shaken by the wind; we
are paralysed through not knowing what our agent in Constantinople is or is not doing; the Divan
has become fanatically warlike and headstrong, and reminds one of Prussia in 1806; the public
here is furiously Turkish and anti-Russian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On October 5 the Porte issued a formal declaration of war. On the 14th the combined
fleets of England and France, which were lying in Besika Bay, moved into the Dardanelles on the
invitation of the Sultan. Mediation was at an end.</p>

<p>A Turkish squadron of twelve sail in the Black Sea were attacked on the 30th while lying at
anchor at Sinope and completely destroyed, with the loss of 4,000 men, leaving
only about 400 alive.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Destruction of the Turkish Fleet.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The news of this massacre, enacted almost under the
very guns of the allied fleet, spread like wildfire through France and Great
Britain, and ignited every warlike spirit that still slumbered. It was alleged that the Turkish
admiral had hauled down his flag before the overwhelming force which attacked him, and that
the Russians had paid no attention to this signal of surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>The Cabinet was much more divided in opinion than the nation. Lord Palmerston, the Home
Secretary, startled the nation by resigning office on December 16, not, however, as was generally
assumed, on account of difference about the Eastern Question.

the Eastern Question that has turned him out, and Court intrigues!&rdquo; Everybody, in fact, believed
that Palmerston had left the Cabinet rather than assent to abandoning Turkey to the tender
mercies of Russia. Prince Albert was vehemently accused by a portion of the Press of being
favourable to the designs of Russia: how far this was from the truth people afterwards came to learn
from his own letters written while these events were in progress. The cry went forth that
Palmerston was the only man who could save the honour of England; in a few days he withdrew
his resignation and confidence was restored.</p>

<p>Before the actual declaration of war, large numbers of British troops had embarked for the
East, and a powerful fleet had been assembled at Spithead for service in the Baltic under Admiral
Sir Charles Napier. To Prince Albert&rsquo;s watchful influence must be attributed the degree to which
the nation now found itself prepared for the coming struggle. For the warlike habits of our
people had been lulled by the peace which, uninterrupted for nearly forty years, had prevailed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
England and other European powers. It would be
difficult to realise at this day how far the nation had
lapsed into unreadiness. Prince Albert incessantly
strove to arouse it from this perilous lethargy. One
result of his efforts had been the establishment during
the summer of 1853 of a temporary camp of exercise
at Chobham, a complete novelty to the generation of
that time. Aldershot, as a place of arms, had no
existence then, but the system initiated at Chobham
has become part of our regular military organisation.
Another result had been the establishment of a permanent
Channel Fleet, which was reviewed by the Queen
at Spithead on August 11, 1853, and described by Prince
Albert as &ldquo;the finest fleet, perhaps, which England
ever fitted out; forty ships of war of all kinds, all
moved by steam-power but three.... The gigantic
ships of war, among them the <i>Duke of
Wellington</i> with 131 guns (a greater
number than was
ever assembled before
in one vessel),
went, without sails and propelled only
by the screw, <i>eleven miles an hour</i>, and
this against wind and tide!
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>State of British Armaments.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This is the
greatest revolution effected in the conduct
of naval warfare which has yet been
known ... and will render many
fleets, like the present Russian one, useless.&rdquo;
Speaking of men-of-war fitted with
the auxiliary screw, he went on: &ldquo;We
have already sixteen at sea and ten in
an advanced state. France has no
more than two, and the other Powers
none.... I write all this, because
last autumn we were bewailing our
defenceless state, and because you know
that, without wishing to be <i>mouche de
coche</i>, I must rejoice to see that achieved
which I had struggled so long and so
hard to effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Great Britain, then, at the outbreak
of the Russian War, possessed a fleet
stronger than the combined flotillas of
any other three Great Powers. Her
land forces were far less satisfactory, for
though they were perfectly disciplined
and well-equipped according to the
existing state of military science,
they were few in numbers and almost
totally without reserves, for the new
Militia could not count for much as
yet.</p>

possible by doubling the Income Tax and increasing the duty on malt and spirits.

Lord Aberdeen, replying to Lord Roden in the House of Lords, stated that a Day
of Humiliation and Prayer would be set apart for the success of British arms.
The Queen immediately wrote to the Prime Minister, reminding him that she
had not been consulted about this, and objecting to the term &ldquo;humiliation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To say (as we probably should) that <i>the great sinfulness of the nation</i> has brought about this war,
when it is the selfishness and ambition and want of honesty of <i>one man</i> and his servants which has
done it, while our conduct throughout has been actuated by unselfishness and honesty, would be too
manifestly repulsive to the feelings of everyone, and would be a mere bit of hypocrisy. Let there
be a Prayer expressive of our great thankfulness for the immense benefits we have enjoyed, and for
the immense prosperity of the country, and entreating God&rsquo;s help and protection in the coming
struggle. In this the Queen would join heart and soul. If there is to be a day set apart, let it be
for Prayer in this sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Day of Solemn Fast, Humiliation, and Prayer was fixed, but, in accordance with the Queen&rsquo;s
feeling, there were no abject expressions used in the Prayers prescribed, only a committal of the
cause of England into the hands of the Almighty to &ldquo;judge between them and her enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Varna, a fortified seaport of Bulgaria, on
the shore of the Black Sea, half way between
the Bosphorus and the mouth of the Danube,
was the rendezvous appointed for the British
and French forces. Lord Raglan, who, as Lord
Fitzroy Somerset, had lost an arm under the
Great Duke at Waterloo, was Commander-in-Chief
of the British Army; Maréchal Saint-Arnaud
that of the French; and the veteran
Omar Pasha that of the Turkish. The Russian
commanders had learnt that, whatever might be
the incapacity of the Sublime Porte for rule,
its troops were composed of excellent fighting
material when well commanded. The Turkish
garrison of Silistria, on the Danube, maintained
such a stubborn defence for many weeks under
two English officers, Captain Butler, of the
Ceylon Rifles, and Lieutenant Nasmyth, of the
East India Company&rsquo;s Service, that at last the
Russians had to raise the siege, on June 22,
after losing more than 12,000 men. At Giurgevo,
again, on July 7, General Soimonoff (who afterwards
fell at the Battle of Inkermann) was badly
beaten, and soon afterwards the whole of the
Russian forces were withdrawn beyond the Pruth,
and Turkish territory was free from invaders. This movement was due, no doubt, in some measure, to the
action of Austria, who had demanded the evacuation
of the Principalities, backed her demand by a
threatening movement of troops, and actually concluded
a convention with the Porte on June 14.</p>

<p>The great arsenal and harbour of Russia was
Sebastopol in the Crimea, and it was on this
point that the attention of Ministers in London
and Paris was chiefly concentrated. There has
been great variance in the accounts of how it
came to be decided that the attack of the Allies
should be directed on that town. It is sufficient
to state here that, on June 29, a despatch was
sent to Lord Raglan, strongly urging the necessity
of a prompt attack upon Sebastopol and the
Russian fleet, but leaving the final decision to
the discretion of the Allied Commanders. Lord
Raglan did not read these instructions as leaving
him any choice, but regarded them, as he afterwards
stated, as &ldquo;little short of an absolute order
from the Secretary of State,&rdquo; and prepared to
obey it. He was a veteran soldier, it is true,
but he had acquired his experience in campaigns
before the days of steam and electricity, and
the incessant and rapid interchange of despatches
between Downing Street and the seat of war no
doubt was somewhat bewildering.</p>

<p>The French Commander-in-Chief, Saint-Arnaud, received similar injunctions from the Emperor
Louis Napoleon, who was as strongly in favour of the project as Palmerston and the Duke of
Newcastle; Lord Raglan, therefore, encountered no opposition from him on the score of strategy.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Invasion of the Crimea.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
After three months of inaction at Varna,
during which the troops suffered severely
from cholera, the invasion
of the Crimea
was undertaken; the
Allied Forces set sail for Eupatoria, and
on September 21 the Duke of Newcastle
telegraphed to the Queen that 25,000
English, 25,000 French, and 8,000 Turks
had safely disembarked at Kalamita Bay,
near the mouth of the River Alma,
about eight miles north of Sebastopol,
without meeting any resistance. The
advance on Sebastopol began on September
19, and on the 20th the Allies
encountered the Russian army, under
Prince Menschikoff, strongly entrenched
on the heights south of the River Alma.
Menschikoff of deliberate purpose had
allowed them to disembark unmolested;
he had chosen what he believed to be an impregnable position, where he intended to keep them in
play till the arrival of reinforcements should enable him to leave his entrenchments and overwhelm
the invaders with superior numbers; he watched them crossing the stream below his position in
full confidence that they were entering the trap prepared for them. But he had underrated the
individual prowess of British and French soldiers. They had discipline, individual gallantry, and
physique in a high degree, but these are
often only so many contributions to the
aggregate of disaster unless directed by
sagacious generalship, and the tactics of
the Allied Forces at the Alma were of
the headlong character of a schoolboy&rsquo;s
playground. Maréchal Saint-Arnaud was
in an agony of illness of approaching
death, as it turned out&mdash;and there was
little cohesion or concert between the
English on the left and the French on
the right of the attacking line. Only
one thing was plain to the men of
both armies&mdash;there were the Russian
batteries, on the heights beyond the
river, with heavy columns of infantry
hanging like a grey cloud along the
crests&mdash;the one thing to do was to get
at them. Saint-Arnaud, addressing his
Generals of Division, Canrobert and
Prince Napoleon, said: &ldquo;With such men as you I have no orders to give; I have but to point
to the enemy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At two o&rsquo;clock the Allies crossed the river under a plunging fire, and advanced up the opposing

laurels to each with scrupulous precision. The brunt
of the fighting no doubt fell to the English share;
that was their good luck in what Mr. McCarthy has
termed a &ldquo;heroic scramble&rdquo;; theirs too was the heaviest
loss. One thing is certain that the day was won by
the Allies, not by the skill of their generals, but by
the valour and endurance of the troops, and that the
two qualities which ensured success were those which
chiefly distinguished the two nations respectively&mdash;the
resolute steadiness and courage of the one, and the
brilliant dash and fury of the other.</p>

<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>A Fruitless Victory.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The French returned their loss at 1,200. What was to be set to the
credit of the account? Menschikoff was in full retreat with his army in great confusion, which
required only the pressure of pursuit to convert into
a hopeless rout. Raglan, the pupil of the Great Duke,
surely had learned a sounder lesson than to allow the
enemy time to reorganise his disordered divisions.
Raglan, of course, was for pursuit, but Saint-Arnaud,
physically and mentally shattered, objected for the reason
that he was weak in cavalry; the English commander
hesitated, perhaps on good grounds, to proceed
alone, and the opportunity was lost.</p>

<p>The news of victory caused a great revulsion of
feeling in England. People had become impatient
during the summer months of inaction at Varna, and
disheartened by the failure of Sir Charles Napier to
carry all before him in the Baltic. Bomarsund, it is
true, had been taken, but Cronstadt and Sweaborg had
proved impregnable. Complaints were general about
the want of vigour displayed in carrying on the war,
and dissatisfaction not only prevailed among the uninformed
public, but even found expression from the
lips of Cabinet Ministers.</p>

<p>The first of War Correspondents. Born in
1821; joined the staff of the <i>Times</i> in 1843,
and has represented that paper in all the considerable
wars which have occurred since.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>A novel feature in the Expedition to the Black
Sea was the presence with the army of war correspondents,
representing the leading daily papers. This
was a symptom of that growth of journalistic enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
which was to receive such notable impetus in the following year by the abolition of the newspaper
stamp duty.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>War Correspondents.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The name of Mr. W. H. Russell, representing the <i>Times</i>, will be long remembered as
that of the pioneer in this new and exciting
form of literature. The vivid descriptions sent
home of the splendid conduct of British troops in the field, and
the excellent relations established between them and their ancient
foes the French, were eagerly perused in England, and sent up the
enthusiasm to fever heat.</p>

<p>But if the war letters in the newspapers were of good service
in allaying public impatience by reporting valorous exploits and heroic
endurance, they tended to intensify the anxiety when the campaign
became prolonged towards winter, without any decisive result. It
had been expected that Sebastopol would be carried by a <i>coup-de-main</i>;
so it might have been, perhaps, had the victory of Alma
been followed up, even on the day after the action. But the views
of Maréchal Saint-Arnaud prevailed again; the project of assaulting
Sebastopol on the north side was abandoned; and the Allies undertook
the terribly hazardous, though, as it happened, successful flank
march upon Balaklava, which, with its convenient harbour, was
selected as the English base and depôt, while the French chose
Kamiesch Bay.</p>

<p>The Battle of Alma took place on September 20; on the 23rd
General Todleben, commanding the defences of Sebastopol, sunk
seven war vessels at the mouth of the harbour. The Allied Fleet, from which this operation was
plainly visible, were thus effectually shut out; the golden opportunity of the speedy capture of the
city by a combined land and sea attack had gone by. Such an attack was made on October 17,
but the fleet could only play at long bowls, and the French batteries were silenced in a few hours.
The first attempt ended in failure. There was nothing for it but a prolonged siege, and the Allied
Land Forces were insufficient to invest the town effectively. Moreover they were threatened by a
Russian army outside, constantly reinforced by fresh troops from the interior. The besiegers themselves
had to stand on the defensive.</p>

<p>On October 25 General Liprandi attacked the English camp at Balaklava with 20,000 or
30,000 men. It is a day to be
much remembered in British
war annals
with pro&shy;found
but melancholy pride,
because of the blunder which
cost the British Army the
loss of two-thirds of its Light
Cavalry.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Balaklava.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The action began
by the capture by the Russians
of four redoubts held
by the Turks. Then took
place a cavalry encounter
which, though it has been
eclipsed in memory by the
subsequent exploit of the
Light Brigade, was, in truth,
not less splendid and far
more fruitful. The Russian
horse, numbering some 3,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
sabres advanced against the British Heavy Cavalry Brigade under General Scarlett.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Cavalry Charges by the Heavy and Light Brigades.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Immensely outnumbered as they were, and hampered by tent ropes and enclosed ground, the Scots Greys
and Enniskillens charged them impetuously. For a minute or two it seemed as
if these fine regiments must be swallowed up in the dense columns of the
enemy, but the Royals and 4th Dragoon Guards moving up on the left, and
the 5th Dragoon Guards on the right, charged the enemy on either flank,
and forced them to give way and fly. The whole affair was over in less than five minutes.</p>

<p>Lord Raglan, who was anxiously waiting for infantry reinforcements, seeing the Russians
preparing to move the guns from the captured redoubts, sent an order to Lord Lucan to prevent
them doing so. &ldquo;Try to prevent the enemy carrying away the guns.&rdquo; What guns? Captain Nolan,
who carried the order, pointed to a battery of eight Russian guns at the end of the valley,
supported by artillery on either flank. &ldquo;There, my lord, is our enemy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and there are
our guns.&rdquo; Lord Lucan hesitated at first, but the order seemed explicit, and he directed Lord Cardigan
to form his Light Brigade into two lines. In the first line were four squadrons of the 13th Light
Dragoons and 17th Lancers; in the second were four squadrons of the 4th Light Dragoons and
11th Hussars, with one squadron of the 8th Hussars as a kind of reserve. The command was given,
and it was obeyed. Six hundred and seventy-three men rode down that valley of death straight for
the guns, on a venture as hopeless and devoted as that of Sir Giles de Argentine at Bannockburn,
and hardly less futile. Only one hundred and ninety-five returned.</p>

<p>On the following day the Russians made a sortie in force upon the English position at Inkermann,
and although they were repulsed by Sir de Lacy Evans&rsquo;s division, there can be no possible doubt
that the Allied Forces at this period were in imminent peril of a terrible disaster. Five days before
the cavalry action of Balaklava, Raglan had informed the War Office that his army was reduced to
16,000, and that he doubted if he could maintain it in the field during the winter, even if Sebastopol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
should be taken first. Week after week the condition of the troops was painted in gloomier colours
by the war correspondents.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Breakdown of Transport and Commissariat.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The transport system had broken down; supplies
of all sorts were running short; the hospital arrangements were miserably
inadequate for the numerous wounded and the still more numerous sick. The
Turkish troops&mdash;men of the same race who had fought so well under English
officers at Silistria&mdash;proved useless&mdash;worse than useless, for they had to be fed&mdash;under their own pashas
in the trenches before Sebastopol.</p>

</div>

<p>The French Emperor took alarm. Hitherto nearly all the fighting had fallen to the share of the
British, and England had very few troops ready to send as reinforcements. Louis Napoleon proposed
to send 20,000 French troops if England would supply the necessary transports. This was undertaken
at once; huts, warm clothing, blankets, tinned meat, and other stores were sent out in ample quantities,
but very few of the cargoes reached their destination. Winter had burst upon the Black Sea with
almost unexampled fury; the transports and cargo ships were scattered. Two French men-of-war
and twenty-four British transports went to the bottom in the hurricane; the elements seemed
to combine with man&rsquo;s mismanagement for the annihilation of the Allied Forces. What our
soldiers had to bear, half clothed, half starved, in those bitter trenches, may be read in Kinglake&rsquo;s
narrative.</p>

<p>While the authorities at home were straining every nerve to send succour to the fast-dwindling
army in the field, news came to England of another great battle, far more sanguinary than any
previous encounter, in which once more the brunt had fallen on the British.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Battle of Inkermann.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Grand Dukes Nicholas and Michael, with the whole forces in Sebastopol, reinforced
by large bodies of troops newly arrived from the Danubian provinces, in all not less than 50,000
men, had attacked the right of the English lines early in the dark morning of November 5.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
The fighting continued till late in the afternoon, the French being engaged also; but General
Canrobert (who had succeeded to the command vacated by the death of Saint-Arnaud), in his
telegram to the Emperor, chivalrously attributed the victory to &ldquo;the remarkable solidity with which
the English army maintained the battle, supported by a portion of General Bosquet&rsquo;s division.&rdquo;
The English loss in the Battle of Inkermann amounted to 2,573 killed and wounded, of which
145 were officers, including four generals; the French lost 1,800, while the Russian casualties were
made out in their official returns at 11,959 killed, wounded, and prisoners.</p>

<p>The Allies paid a heavy price for this victory, but the carnage was not in vain. The power
of Russia was crippled for a moment, and time was given for the succour which busy hands and
brains were preparing in London and Paris. The most heartrending spectacle of all was the state
of the hospitals at Scutari. No sooner did a description of them reach London than a fund was
opened to supply their wants. More than £25,000 was collected, and English women organised
themselves as nurses, and placed themselves under the direction of Miss Florence Nightingale.

glory of having initiated a movement which has extended far beyond the limits of the Crimean

<p>It would be no pleasant task to retrace at length the sorrowful story of the siege. British
army organisation had broken down hopelessly, and people in England were maddened by the
descriptions in the Press, perhaps in some instances exaggerated, how their brothers and sons were
dying in the trenches, not by steel and shell, but from the starvation, disease, exposure, vermin,
to which the culpable incapacity of British officials, as it was believed, had exposed them.

<p>Lord Fitzroy James Henry Somerset, created
Baron Raglan in 1852, was the eighth and youngest
son of the Fifth Duke of Beaufort. He was Military
Secretary to the Duke of Wellington, 1819&ndash;1852,
Master-General of Ordnance, 1852, and was appointed
Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in the Crimea,
1854.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The war went on; the Allies being strengthened
in a minute degree by the active adherence of the
little kingdom of Sardinia, of which the gallant and
resolute monarch, Victor Emmanuel, perceived ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
advantage to his designs on the throne of Italy through alliance
with Great Britain and France in a war which concerned him
about as much as it did the Queen of the Sandwich Islands.
The bombardment of Sebastopol was resumed on April 10, and
400 great guns battered away without much result. But the
trenches were drawing ever closer round the doomed city, and
the Allies made a successful expedition to Kertch on May 24,
where they destroyed immense stores provided for the Russian
army, as well as a convoy of cargo ships in the Sea of Azoff.
On June 18 a combined assault was delivered on the Malakoff
and Redan Forts, but the Allies were repulsed with heavy loss.
It had been undertaken against the judgment of Lord Raglan,
who yielded reluctantly to General Pelissier&rsquo;s urgent request.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Death of Lord Raglan.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
He took this reverse grievously to heart: harassed as he had

AT WINDSOR CASTLE, April 18, 1855.</p>

<p>The friendly feeling between England and France which sprang out of their common interests in the war against Russia, found expression in an interchange
of visits between the Sovereigns of the two countries. The Emperor Napoleon III. and his beautiful Empress visited the Queen at Windsor in April 1855.
They were met at Dover by the Prince Consort on the 16th, and remained at Windsor until the 21st. One of the most impressive ceremonies of their visit was
the Installation of the Emperor as a Knight of the Garter.</p>

<p>He was awarded the Victoria Cross for gallant conduct in throwing

personal risk, the enemy&rsquo;s wounded from the fury of the Turks.</p>
</div>

<p>In assuming the chief command of the British Army in
this war, Lord Raglan had undertaken a task of peculiar
and, in some respects, novel difficulty. He brought ripe
experience, it is true, acquired under the greatest soldier of
the century, but the lapse of years had brought about so
many changes in military appliances and scientific inventions,
that much of that experience was rendered obsolete. He
was the first British general who had to conduct operations
in the field advised, controlled, directed, censured by telegraphic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
despatches from the War Office. He had, moreover,
to act in concert with an ally, brave, indeed, but
sensitive, and it was of the nature of things that
their counsels should sometimes clash, at least, that
their judgment should not always be identical. Little
reference has been made to the angry impatience
expressed in the English press and Parliament in
regard to what was freely condemned as the incapacity
and dilatoriness of Lord Raglan, because time and
reflection have amply vindicated his renown. But it
must have been galling to him at the time, and
greatly aggravated the difficulties of his position. The
best evidence of his genuine force of character is found
in the patient courage with which he fulfilled his office
to the last, and the enthusiastic devotion which he
won from all ranks serving under him.</p>

<p>The command of the British forces devolved upon
General Simpson. On August 16 General Liprandi
made a formidable attempt to raise the siege by an
attack on the French and Sardinian position on the
Tchernaya, but was repulsed with
tremendous slaughter.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Battle of Tchernaya.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This was the last encounter in the open field. The final assault
on the town was opened by a tremendous fire from the
Allied batteries on September 5, and the bombardment
continued without intermission throughout the 6th and 7th. On the morning of the 8th the French made
a splendid dash at the Malakoff Fort, the key of Sebastopol, and captured it. The English fared not so
well in an attempt to storm the Redan and suffered severely in a repulse. But the defence was at an end.</p>

<p>A dispute had arisen out of circumstances even more trivial than
the question of custody of the Holy Places, which led to the Crimean war.
A vessel termed a &ldquo;lorcha,&rdquo; lying in the Canton river in
October 1856, was boarded by Chinese officials,
who took away twelve men accused of piracy,
although the lorcha <i>Arrow</i> was flying the British flag.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Lorcha &ldquo;Arrow.&rdquo;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The British Consul at Canton demanded the release of these men, according to
the treaty of 1843; but the Chinese Governor Yeh declared that the
<i>Arrow</i> was not a British vessel but a Chinese pirate, and refused
to comply with the Consul&rsquo;s demand. It was proved, however, that
the <i>Arrow</i> had been duly registered as a British vessel, though her
registration had actually expired ten days before the arrest of the
men. Mr. Parkes, the British Consul, appealed to Sir John
Bowring, British Minister at Hongkong. Bowring was determined to
stand no nonsense from the Chinaman: nor was he going to trouble
himself whether the <i>Arrow</i> was entitled to fly the British ensign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
or not! As a matter of fact, he wrote to Parkes that the expiry of the registration had deprived
her owners of the right, but that as the Chinese did not know that, they must be held responsible
for insulting the flag. Anyhow, it was
enough for Bowring that Chinese officials
had dared to take men by force from
under that flag, whether it had been
hoisted rightfully or wrongfully. He
sent an ultimatum to Yeh, demanding
the release of the men and an ample
apology within forty-eight hours, or he
would begin hostilities. Yeh released
the men, and promised that greater
caution should be observed in future,
but he refused to apologise, maintaining
that the Arrow was in fact a Chinese
vessel. Incredible as it may seem that
such powers should be vested in a
British Minister, and still more so, that
he should employ them in such a
miserable quarrel, nevertheless Bowring
ordered up the fleet
and Canton was
severely bombarded for several days.

risen in revolt, murdered their

whole peninsula was in rebellion.
There had been awful massacres
too; English men, women, and

hundreds; most hideous of all
there were circumstantial stories
of outrage, followed by torture,
committed upon our women. A
terrible moan for vengeance rose
throughout the land. There

Black and bloody as the reality afterwards proved to be, the mutineers were not shown to have

<p>This great convulsion is always referred
to as the Indian Mutiny, because
of the violent revolt of so many native
regiments in the British service; but
it was far more than a mutiny; it
was an insurrection of the Indian races
against the European conqueror, a common
rising of Hindoo and Mahomedan
against the Christian power. Disaffection
to British rule had never ceased
to smoulder: how should it, seeing
that so many native rulers had been
deposed, so many others placed in inglorious dependency or on pension? The misrule and oppression
of these potentates had been forgotten by the people who once groaned under them, just as the
Jacobites who shouted for &ldquo;the auld Stuarts back again&rdquo; forgot what the people had endured under
the Stuart kings. Dost Mahomed had shown an example how the Feringhi could be dealt with,
and there were a thousand grievances against English officers and magistrates to be wiped out.</p>

<p>Lord Dalhousie had resigned the Governor-Generalship in March 1856, and his eight years of
rule had been regulated by a policy of annexation. Deeply penetrated with the capacity of the
Indian races and their country for moral and material development, he perceived how fatal was the
native system of rule to all progress. Consequently he was not rigidly scrupulous in every case
about the precise justice of the means by which one principality after another was added to the
British dominions. The greatest happiness of the greatest number often involves disappointment
and even direct injury to the few.
Dalhousie vindicated his policy by the
splendid energy he showed in making
roads, railways, and telegraphs, in reducing
taxation, and in general measures
for the good of the people; but he undoubtedly
left a feeling of soreness and
resentment that only waited a fitting
opportunity to take effect.</p>

<p>Out of this discontent arose a widespread
conspiracy against British rule in
the beginning of 1857. It is believed by
some that the military rising was premature,
and disconcerted the measures of
those organising the general revolt. Be
that as it may, the earliest overt acts of
rebellion took place among the troops.</p>

<p>The value of the bicycle in actual warfare has yet to be proved; but, like the field telegraph and the military

<p>The effect of the Minié rifle, carried by some of the Russian troops in the Crimea, had been
so remarkable, that the British military authorities had decided that the day of &ldquo;Brown Bess&rdquo;&mdash;the
smooth-bore musket&mdash;had gone by. In common with the rest of the forces, therefore, the
Enfield rifle was served out to the Indian troops in 1856. Now the paper of the cartridges used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
in this weapon was greased, and the idea was industriously circulated among the Sepoys that the
lubricant used was a mixture of the fat of cows and pigs&mdash;a most ingenious falsehood, if falsehood
it were&mdash;a most unlucky fact,
if fact it were&mdash;for the native
troops were composed partly
of Mahomedans, to whom, of
all animals, the hog is most
loathsome, and partly of Hindoos,
by whom, of all animals,
the cow is held most sacred.
Falsehood or fact, the story
served a sinister purpose, for
although the issue of the
objectionable cartridges was
stopped in January, and Lord
Canning, the Governor-General,
issued a Proclamation in
May to the Army of Bengal,
declaring that the story of an
intentional affront to religion
and caste on the part of the
Government was utterly groundless, the early months of 1857 witnessed repeated instances of military
insubordination, and some of the native regiments had to be disbanded. On Saturday, May 9,
eighty-five men of the Bengal Cavalry were sentenced at Meerut to long periods of imprisonment and
hard labour for refusing to use the cartridges issued to them.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Rising at Meerut.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Next day, Sunday,
the whole native garrison at
Meerut, the largest military station in India,
mutinied, killed several of their officers, massacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
some Europeans, and breaking open the gaol, released
their imprisoned comrades. The European troops at
Meerut drove them out of their cantonments; but
allowed the mutineers to march to Delhi, where the
octogenarian representative of the Great Mogul still
held his court as a subject of Queen Victoria and
pensioner of the East India Company. This old man
they proclaimed Emperor of India, and the military
mutiny assumed at once the character of national
rebellion. All the patriotism that had been outraged,
all the aspirations that had been crushed, all the private
interests that had suffered by Lord Dalhousie&rsquo;s annexation
of the Punjab, of Oude, of Sattara, and of Jhansi,
found their outlet and opportunity in the mutiny of
the garrison of Meerut. The great Koh-i-noor diamond,
symbol of the sovereignty of Lahore, had been
displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851: the diamond
might be gone beyond recall, but the tyranny of the
Sikh Ameers had passed from memory also, and a
resolute effort might restore them. There are known
various modes of pre-historic telegraph. In the Scottish
Highlands of old the fiery cross, passed from hamlet
to hamlet, summoned the clansmen to arms; on the
Borders the bale-fires leapt from height to height to
rouse the land: not less sure and hardly less swift was
the symbol of &ldquo;chupatties,&rdquo; little unleavened cakes, of
which two were left with the head man of each village of Northern India on an appointed morning,
with directions to make similar cakes and pass them on. When the standard of rebellion was hoisted
on the citadel of Delhi, the train had been laid and all
was in readiness for an explosion which should shatter
to fragments British rule in India.</p>

action at Kooshab, about forty-four miles from Bushire. When the
3rd Bombay Light Cavalry charged the enemy&rsquo;s square, Lieut. Moore,

British arms what we must be honest enough to own
as the defeat of Chilianwalla. While the rebellion was
spreading like wildfire through the whole of the rest of
the North-West, and blazing through Oude into Lower

<p class="clearright">Of course, severe reflections have been passed on
those in command of European troops at Meerut and
in the neighbourhood of Delhi for allowing the revolted
regiments to pass unmolested from the former to the
latter place. There was indecision shown, no doubt.
The Commandant at Meerut telegraphed to Delhi what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
had occurred, and did no more. Next day the Mahomedans of Delhi rose and joined the Sepoys, and
the Europeans in the Residency could only blow up their magazine to prevent it falling into the
hands of the rebels. It is easy to sit in an elbow chair and pronounce
the opinion that if the authorities at Meerut had showed
presence of mind the rebellion might have been quashed at the
outset; but it is a fearful thing for soldiers to have to turn their
arms suddenly against their comrades; and any hesitation or weakness
shown on that occasion may be forgotten in the tribute due to
the whole body of military and civil officers for their conduct in
what followed.</p>

<p>Lord Canning played a splendid part. Of all moods of the
human creature there is none so ungovernable as fear. The suddenness
of the outbreak, the rapidity of its spread, the atrocious
massacres which marked its progress, created a
wild panic in Calcutta and other European communities.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Lord Canning&rsquo;s Presence of Mind.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Canning was assailed on all sides by
the insane counsels of terror. He was urged to take the most savage
methods of reprisal. The dethroned King of Oude was living near
Calcutta. Of all Dalhousie&rsquo;s annexations perhaps that of Oude was
the one which most afflicted sensitive consciences; and the people
of Calcutta, convinced that the King of Oude was preparing schemes of vengeance, besought the
Governor-General to seize his person. Canning responded by receiving the King and his Vizier to
reside in his own house. The clamours against him rose to frenzy: people nicknamed him &ldquo;Clemency
Canning&rdquo;; they shrieked for his recall; but through all the tumult this great man kept his head cool
and his nerve steady.</p>

<p>The official residence of the Viceroy of India. Built in 1799&ndash;1804 by Lord Wellesley at a cost of about

<p>Happily there were other cool
heads besides the Governor-General&rsquo;s.
On May 11 information of the outbreak
at Meerut was telegraphed from
Calcutta to Lahore, the capital of the
Punjab. The Governor, Sir John
(afterwards Lord) Lawrence was absent
at Rawul Pindee, having left full power
in the hands of the Judicial Commissioner,
Mr. Robert Montgomery. Four
thousand Sepoy troops lay at Meean
Meer, five or six miles from Lahore,
and Mr. Montgomery had to decide on
the instant whether these should be
assumed to be contemplating mutiny.
He came to a speedy decision. They
must not be allowed the chance.
There was a great ball in Lahore that
night; among the guests were the civil
and military chiefs of the district.
Mr. Montgomery consulted with them and it was resolved to disarm the native troops. A parade
was ordered for daybreak at Meean Meer: twelve guns loaded with grape were placed along one
side of the parade ground. The troops were formed up in line of contiguous columns facing the
guns and ordered to pile arms. They obeyed, for to hesitate
was death. The rifles were carried off in carts, and the station
was left in possession of 1,300 European troops. This was
perhaps the most critical moment of the Mutiny. Nothing short
of Mr. Montgomery&rsquo;s firmness, supported by the military commanders,
could have ensured the
safety of the Punjab.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">NATIVE HOUSES IN THE FORT, BOMBAY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The darkest page of the
book of Mutiny is that which
contains the story of Cawnpore.
In May 1857 there were 3,000
native troops at that place, and
about 300 Europeans, under
command of Sir Hugh Wheeler,
an old man of seventy-five.
Wheeler had reason to expect his
force to mutiny, and appealed
to Nana Sahib, a neighbouring
prince representing the dethroned
Mahratta Peishwah of Poonah,
to help him. Nana had an
undoubtedly genuine grievance
against the Government. On
the death of the last Peishwah,
Lord Dalhousie had refused to
continue the pension to his
adopted son Nana, thereby violating the Hindoo principle that all the rights of sonship, material as
well as spiritual, are conveyed by adoption. Nana, whose real name was Seereek Dhoondoo Punth,
was rich and hospitable, and delighted in entertaining English officers and their ladies at his residence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
near Cawnpore. He responded
cordially to Sir
Hugh&rsquo;s invitation, and
came at once to Cawnpore
with 300 men and
two guns, to help to
keep order.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Rising at Cawnpore.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
His arrival
coincided with the revolt
of the
garrison,
and he
placed himself at once
at the head of the
mutineers. Wheeler had
taken refuge in an old
hospital building with
about 1,000 Europeans,
of whom 280 were
women and girls, with
about the same number
of children. A hasty entrenchment was thrown up, and
Wheeler refused Nana&rsquo;s summons to surrender. For
nineteen days, under the tropical sun of June, this
handful of brave men maintained the defence of their
crumbling mud wall against thousands of rebels. The
assailants were reinforced by a contingent of Oude men,
who made a fierce assault on the place; but the English
were fighting for more than their mere
lives; the presence of their women and
children made each man bear himself
like a Paladin. The attack was repulsed,
and this prolonged resistance
soon began to tell on the prestige of
Nana, for Hindoos and Mahomedans
alike appreciate prowess in the field.
He offered terms to the besieged: &ldquo;All
those who are in no way connected
with the acts of Lord Dalhousie, and who are willing to lay down their arms, shall receive a safe
passage to Allahabad.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">STATUE OF THE QUEEN AND TELEGRAPH OFFICE, BOMBAY.</p>

<p>The Statue, executed in white marble by Noble, was unveiled by Lord Northbrook in 1872. A
native superstition ascribes the origin of the recent plague to vengeance for an insult offered to
this statue, which was one morning found bedaubed with tar.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The terms were accepted. The little garrison had done all that flesh and blood and gallant
souls could do. The survivors of the siege embarked in boats on the Ganges, prepared by Nana&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
orders. The women and children were
all aboard, the men were following.
At that moment a bugle sounded; instantly
the straw awnings of the boats
burst into flame, and the native rowers
leaped out. A fire of grape and musketry
poured down on the frail craft,
and continued till Tantia Topee, Nana&rsquo;s
lieutenant, sounded the &ldquo;Cease fire!&rdquo;
Then the survivors, 125 English&shy;women
and children, many of them sorely wounded, were
collected and driven back to the town. One only
of the boats escaped, drifting down the Ganges, a
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Massacre.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
target for innumerable marksmen
on both banks. A dozen men
landed to drive off the assailants; in their absence
the boat was captured, and those on board&mdash;sixty-five
men, twenty-five women, and four children&mdash;were
haled back to Cawnpore. The men were shot on
the spot; the women and children were crammed into the prison-house with the others. Cholera and
dysentery soon carried off eighteen women and seven children&mdash;more fortunate than their companions.</p>

<p>Benares is the sacred city of the Hindoos. It contains innumerable

to the worship of Shiva; its dome is overlaid with gold. To Buddhists
the stupa now called Damek, three miles to the north of Benares, erected
on the spot where Buddha first expounded his doctrine, is a place of
pilgrimage. But the most prominent object from the river is the Mohammedan
mosque built by Aurungzeb, son of Shah Jehan. Its slender
minarets are 147 feet high.</p>

</div>

<p>Nana&rsquo;s visions of rule were becoming overcast.
The English had rallied from the first shock of the
Mutiny; troops, before which he knew his men dared
not stand, were drawing near; Havelock had already
routed Tantia Topee, with 4,000 of Nana&rsquo;s best fighting
men, and Neill was at Allahabad. The rebellion
was mastered, but Nana&rsquo;s vengeance, if it was to be
balked of its full scope, at least should be complete
on those who were in his power. A company of
Sepoys was ordered up to the house where the
Englishwomen were imprisoned. Unhappy creatures,
their approaching fate cannot have caused them much
concern; they were in every circumstance of suffering
and misery already. For nearly four weeks they had
not been able to change their tattered clothing, nor
had a drop of water to wash in. The Sepoys began
firing through the windows, but there were traces of
mercy in their hearts; they fired high and ineffectively,
and were marched home again. In the evening five
men were sent up and entered the house; awful sounds
were heard within, and twice one of the butchers came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
out and exchanged his broken, bloody
sword for a fresh weapon. At length
all was still; the five men, weary
with slaughter, came out and went
off, locking the door behind them.
Next morning they returned with a
fatigue party, cleared out that fearful
house of blood, and flung the bodies
down a dry well.</p>

<p>There is nothing in English
history, at least during the last six
centuries, approaching in horror to
the massacre of Cawnpore, and it is
well that one is not often called on
to witness&mdash;to share in&mdash;the fury, the
wild cry for revenge, that rose from
England when the tale came to be
told there. Nana Sahib waited to
encounter the victorious Havelock on
July 16; he was completely defeated, fled from the field in the
direction of Nepaul, and has never since been heard of. Of the
twelve men who left the boat which floated down the Ganges,
four escaped after extraordinary adventures, by favour of a friendly
rajah&mdash;the sole survivors of the European community at Cawnpore.</p>

<p>This was one of the most daring exploits in a campaign
remarkable for deeds of gallantry. Advancing
across a broken drawbridge in broad daylight, in the
face of the enemy&rsquo;s defences, Lieutenants Home and
Salkeld, with native sappers to carry the gunpowder,
succeeded in laying eight bags of powder against the gate.
Home leaped into the ditch unhurt; Salkeld, who held a
lighted port fire, was badly wounded and fell back on
the bridge, handing the port-fire as he fell to Sergeant
Burgess, who was immediately shot dead. Sergeant
Carmichael then advanced, picked up the port-fire, and
lighted the fuse, but fell mortally wounded. The gate
was blown in, killing all its defenders but one, and the
British entered without opposition.</p>

<p>Seeing that it has been
necessary to relate some of
the many atrocities perpetrated
by the rebel leaders, it
would be unfair to keep
regarding one that
was enacted here by an English
officer. A brave young fellow called Hodson, commanding
an irregular force well-known as Hodson&rsquo;s Horse, asked General
Wilson&rsquo;s permission to capture the King of Delhi and his family.
Wilson consented, provided the old King&rsquo;s life should be preserved.
The King and his sons had taken refuge in an immense
enclosure, the tomb of the Emperor Hoomayoon, adjoining the
city, where he was guarded by a strong armed force. Hodson
quietly rode up with a small escort and called on the troops to
lay down their arms. Believing, no doubt, that the English officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
had ample force at hand to enforce his command, they instantly obeyed. The King&rsquo;s life was spared,
according to orders, but, shameful to say, Hodson summoned the three Princes&mdash;the King&rsquo;s sons&mdash;before
him, and shot them with his own hand. It was a horrible act, but in the spirit of vengeance
then prevalent, many were found to justify it, and Hodson was
never brought to trial. He was killed in action at Lucknow not
long after.</p>

<p>While these events were passing, General Anson, Commander-in-Chief
of the forces in India, died on June 27. It was decided
to send out Sir Colin Campbell to replace him. On being asked
when he would be ready to start Sir Colin answered with characteristic
promptitude: &ldquo;To-morrow&rdquo;; and he sailed the following
day without waiting to prepare his outfit.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Lawrence,<a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G"></a><a href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a> Chief Commissioner of Oude, had
fortified and provisioned the Residency of Lucknow where, on
July 2, he was besieged, having with him a single battalion of
Europeans and all the European inhabitants of the station.

Lawrence was killed at the opening of the siege, but the little
garrison held out with magnificent resolution
till, on September 25, they were relieved by
Havelock and Outram. But these generals
were in turn hemmed in by immense masses of rebel troops, and
it was not until Sir Colin Campbell fought his way to Lucknow,
on November 17, that the garrison with the women and children
could be considered to be relieved. One of those who endured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
this long and painful siege was that Dr. Brydon, who had ridden alone into Jellalabad after the awful

Havelock&rsquo;s masterly generalship

Colin was obliged to suspend

General Wyndham, who had been defeated by the Gwalior

<p>This building, erected in 1629&ndash;1648 to serve as the Mausoleum of Arjamand Benu Begam, wife
of the Emperor Shah Jehan, is reputed the most beautiful specimen of architecture in India,
perhaps in the world. It is of white marble and precious stones, and possesses a feminine grace
and charm which no photograph can reproduce.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It throws some light on the magnitude
of what is usually called the
Indian Mutiny, that upwards of 2,000
of the enemy were killed in the final
attack, and 100 of their guns taken.
Those who had begun by putting down
a mutiny had to end by re-conquering
the greater part of India.</p>

<p>Sir Colin Campbell (now Lord
Clyde) continued the campaign in Oude
after the Fall of Lucknow, ably assisted
by Jang Bahádur of Nepál, until that
province was entirely subdued by the
end of 1858. Sir Hugh Rose (afterwards
Lord Strathnairn) was opposed
to the last in Central India by the
Ranee of Jhansi, a Princess of extraordinary
character, who rode in battle
like a modern Joan of Arc, and fell, sabre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
in hand, at the head of her troops. Tantia Topee, the former lieutenant of Nana, was the last to hold
out, but at length he, too, was taken in April 1859, and hanged for his share in the horrors of Cawnpore.</p>

<p>It was not possible that such a convulsion should pass
through the peninsula of Hindostan without shaking down
everything that could be shaken in its institutions.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>End of the East India Company&rsquo;s Rule.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The English public&mdash;the average English Parliament man&mdash;knew
of the existence of British rule in India,
and could lay finger on Calcutta in the
map. But that was about the utmost
precise knowledge of Indian affairs possessed
by most people, until attention was violently forced
to them by the Great Mutiny. Then it dawned upon them
that this mighty dominion was governed by the directors of
a trading company, who exercised all the powers of empire,
civil and military, deriving their authority from
a charter signed by Queen Elizabeth. Various
limitations and reforms, indeed, had been imposed
by Parliament on &ldquo;John Company&rdquo;;
still, the whole system had become an archaism,
as uncertain in practice as it was indefensible
in theory. The time for sweeping changes had
come, not because the directors of the East
India Company had abused their authority;
but the safety of the Empire required that the
Crown should enter now upon the heritage
won by the commercial enterprise of its subjects.
The Act for the better government of
India was framed on a series of Resolutions laid
before a Committee of the whole House, and became
law in the autumn of 1858. It provided that the
Administration of India should pass wholly out of the
hands of the Company into those of the Queen, governing
through a Secretary of State and a Council of fifteen,
seven of whom were to be nominated by the Court of
Directors and eight by the Crown. The Governor-General
was made a Viceroy, the Indian Navy was discontinued,
and the twenty-four European Regiments in the Company&rsquo;s
Service were amalgamated with the Royal army.</p>

<p>The Island of Ceylon has a population exceeding 3,000,000. Its principal product is tea, of
which in 1896 over 100,000,000 lbs. were exported. The chief town is Colombo. Kandy, situated
on a beautiful lake in the interior, was the capital of the native kingdom before its annexation by
the British in 1815.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the squall that was to overturn the Ministry came from a quarter which nobody could have
foreseen. On January 14 a murderous attack was made on the Emperor and Empress of the French
in Paris. An Italian refugee, Felice Orsini, well known in England, waited, with
a number of fellow-ruffians, at the door of the Opera House in the Rue Lepelletier,
and threw three bombs, charged with a powerful explosive, at the Imperial carriage as it drew up.
The effect was appalling: the intended victims escaped unhurt, but ten persons were blown to death
among the bystanders, and no less than 156 were wounded, of whom Orsini himself was one. All this
was dreadful enough, and yet the connection thereof with the stability of Palmerston&rsquo;s Administration
might seem exceedingly remote. It was established in the following way. Orsini, a man of good birth
and attractive exterior, had been very well received in English society, and his appeals on behalf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the Italian provinces of Austria had received polite attention, and, among enthusiastic advocates of
freedom, a great deal of sympathy. London was then, as it remains to this day, a sanctuary for
political refugees from all the ends of the earth. Palmerston,
however, had enough common-sense and honesty to recognise that
it was one thing to allow fugitives to shelter in England, and quite
another to take no precautions as to their good behaviour, and
he prepared and introduced a Bill to strengthen the law dealing
with conspiracy to murder. This was vehemently opposed on the
first reading by Lord John
Russell, but Disraeli and
the Conservatives helped
to carry that stage by a
large majority. In the interval,
however, before the
second reading, public
opinion had undergone a
marked change. The tone
of the French Press had
become intensely insulting
towards Great Britain;
people in London had got
it in their heads that the
Conspiracy to Murder Bill
had been prepared at the
dictation of the French Ambassador,
and Palmerston
was suspected of being at his old game of truckling to Louis Napoleon.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Government Defeat and Resignation.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The suspicion was fatal to him.
An amendment to the second reading,
moved by Mr. Milner Gibson, was supported
by Disraeli and 146 Conservatives, and carried against
the Government by a majority of nineteen.
Palmerston resigned at once,
and Lord Derby began his second administration
with his eldest son, Lord
Stanley, at the Colonial Office, Lord
Malmesbury at the Foreign Office, and
Disraeli leading the House of Commons
as Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>Disraeli had once taunted Palmerston
with having no domestic policy.
&ldquo;His external system,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was
turbulent and aggressive, that his rule at
home may be tranquil and unassailed.&rdquo;
That was, in truth, the greater part of
the secret of Palmerston&rsquo;s popularity;
he refrained from exciting apprehension
and stirring combustible questions.
He made no enemies at home, though
he might be careless in giving offence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
abroad. But that was a rôle not at all suited to Disraeli&rsquo;s ambition. He knew that at any moment
something might happen to drive his party out of office, and he resolved to prepare a soft place to
fall on. It would be a fine stroke to take Lord John Russell&rsquo;s favourite project out of his hands, to
&ldquo;dish the Whigs&rdquo; by lowering the
franchise. John Bright had returned to
active politics and was stirring up the
people in the north to agitate for Reform.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Disraeli&rsquo;s Reform Bill.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
He would take the wind out of

<p class="clearright">It was an unlucky device. The Bill
was not a very formidable one, but it
disturbed a great question. Two members
of the Cabinet, Mr. Walpole and
Mr. Henley, threw up their offices rather
than join in work which they, in common
with most Conservatives in the
country, considered alien from Conservative
principles. The Whigs and Radicals
would have no hand in such a measure,
which they exposed as a sham, and
Russell persuaded the House to reject it by a majority of thirty-nine. Neither did the Bill serve its
author&rsquo;s purpose in the country. When Lord Derby appealed to the constituencies, the response
came, at the end of May 1859, in the form of a feeble accession to Conservative numbers, not strong
enough to avert defeat by thirteen votes on a vote of want of confidence, moved by a young member
put up by the combined Whigs, Radicals, and Peelites&mdash;the Marquis of Hartington (now Duke
of Devonshire). The only effects of
Disraeli&rsquo;s stratagem had been to disgust
and disunite his own party, and to cause
his opponents to sink their differences
in united action.</p>

Lord John Russell refused any

which shut out Lord Clarendon, who
declined any other appointment. At the
moment, as it happened, England was
keeping scrupulously clear of the conflict
between France and Austria. The
Queen&rsquo;s speech to the new Parliament
had announced that &ldquo;a strict and impartial
neutrality&rdquo; should be maintained, and this was done in spite of persistent attempts on the part
of Louis Napoleon to secure the assistance of Great Britain in the deliverance of Italy, in spite, too,
of the strong sympathy entertained by Mr. Gladstone and others in the Cabinet for the cause of
Italian nationality. There was, however, a shrewd distrust of the French Emperor growing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>

In fact, the development of the arsenal at

not without justice, as indicating a contemplated

The immense improvement which
had been recently effected in
arms of precision caused irregular
troops to assume far greater
importance in the calculations of
an intending invader than they
ever had before; and the same cause, by encouraging fine marksmanship
and developing competitive skill at
the targets, has imparted to the Volunteers
of 1859 a permanence quite without precedent in the history of
similar martial movements.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Budget
of 1860 contained a proposal
which brought about
his final rupture with the
Conservative party. He
proposed to repeal the
paper duty.<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Question of the Paper Duty.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Now the burdens upon journalism, originally imposed with the
deliberate intention of limiting the number
and regulating the political character of newspapers,
had already been greatly reduced since
the beginning of the reign. The stamp duty had stood at a
penny on each copy of a newspaper till 1855, when it was abolished;
but there remained still a pretty heavy tax on paper. Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
proposal to abolish it was met with strong opposition from
all sections of politicians, and, strangely enough, from paper
manufacturers themselves, as well as from the proprietors of high-priced
journals. There was, besides, a vague, but very general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
dread of the effect on the public mind of the multiplication of cheap literature. Nevertheless, the
Budget Resolutions removing the paper tax passed through Committee, though the last of them was only
carried by a majority of nine votes. At the present day, the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s proposals,
having passed through that ordeal, would be regarded as impregnable. It was otherwise in 1860. Lord
Lyndhurst, then in his eighty-ninth year, and so frail in body that a rail had to be fixed opposite his
seat to support him in speaking, joined the opposition raised in the House of Lords to the repeal of
the paper tax, and made a marvellously vigorous and effective attack on the proposal. The Lords
vetoed the repeal by a majority of eighty-nine.</p>

<p>Ministerialists were very indignant; the House of Lords had violated the Constitution; they had
refused to sanction the repeal of a tax ordered by the House of Commons, and thereby infringed the
privileges of that Chamber.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>A Constitutional Problem.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The next step would be that the Lords would claim
the right of imposing taxation&mdash;the cherished monopoly of the House of Commons.
It was certainly an awkward question, but Palmerston was equal to the
occasion. He averted a popular storm by moving for a Select Committee to examine and report on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the degree, if any, in which the Lords had exceeded their powers. The Committee sat for two
months, and reported that no breach of privilege was involved in the refusal of the Lords to
ratify the repeal of a tax. It was not the re-imposition of a tax, for, although the Lords have
no power to impose taxation, a tax can neither be repealed or imposed without the concurrence
of both Houses. In the end the difficulty was got over by Palmerston, who moved certain
resolutions affirming the exclusive right of the House of Commons to impose or remit taxation.</p>

<p>Serious trouble had broken out again between Great Britain and China. Mr. Bruce, brother to
the Earl of Elgin, had set out for Pekin as British Plenipotentiary, in company with the French
Plenipotentiary, as provided by the Treaty of Tien-tsin. They were escorted by a
squadron, chiefly consisting of gunboats, under Admiral Hope; but on arriving at
the mouth of the Pei-ho they found the passage obstructed by booms and defended by recent
fortifications. As the authorities at Tien-tsin returned evasive answers to the Admiral&rsquo;s remonstrances,
he determined to force a passage. The gunboats advanced up the Pei-ho on June 24, when suddenly
a tremendous fire was opened on them
from masked batteries in the forts. The
<i>Kestrel</i> was sunk, the <i>Lee</i> had to be run
ashore to avoid sinking, the <i>Plover</i>, which
carried the Admiral&rsquo;s flag, was disabled,
so that he had to shift his flag to the
<i>Cormorant</i>, and the Admiral himself,
being severely wounded, had to hand
over the command to Captain Shadwell.
It was determined to make an immediate
attempt to carry the forts by assault.
A body of 1,000 men, including sixty
French, were landed at 7 p.m., but,
owing to the mud, which was knee, and
even waist-deep, only about fifty men
succeeded in reaching the furthest of
three ditches surrounding the south fort.
Their ammunition was wet, all the scaling ladders, except one, either had been broken by the tremendous
fire from the fort or had stuck in the mud. Ten brave fellows rushed forward with this one, but three
of them were shot dead at once, and five were desperately wounded. There was nothing for it but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
retreat. The loss in this disastrous
affair was eighty-nine officers and men
killed and 345 wounded.</p>

<p>Of course such a treacherous act
could not go unpunished. An ultimatum
was sent demanding an apology
and the fulfilment of the Treaty of
Tien-tsin, including the payment of
the war indemnity of 4,000,000 taels.
Lord Elgin and Baron Gros, the
Plenipotentiaries who acted for the
Allies in the Treaty of Tien-tsin, proceeded
to Hongkong to enforce the
demands of England and France, supported
by an army under Sir Hope
Grant, in which several Sikh regiments
volunteered to serve, and a French
contingent under General Cousin de
Montauban, afterwards distinguished as
Comte Palikao. The Plenipotentiaries

Elgin and Baron de Gros arrived at Hongkong

found that the Chinese Council had returned

which left no alternative but immediate
action. The Allied Forces advanced on
July 26, the English from Chefow, and the
French from Tah-lien-hwan; they captured
the Tangku Forts, with forty-five guns, on
August 14, and the Taku Forts, containing
about 400 guns, on the 20th, the English
loss on the latter occasion amounting to
seventeen killed and 183 wounded. Sir

The Chinese forces had disappeared, but the

peace, and on September 13 Lord Elgin&rsquo;s
secretaries, Mr. Parkes and Mr. Loch,
with Mr. Bowlby, the Times&rsquo; correspondent,
and some British and French
officers, rode on to Tungchow a town
within twelve miles of Pekin, to arrange
the preliminaries of an interview between
the Plenipotentiaries of the Allies and
the Chinese. A camping ground was allotted for the Allied Forces about five
miles short of Tungchow, but before Grant and de Montauban could occupy
it, a large Chinese army had surrounded the position. Mr. Parkes, Mr. Loch, and their party, protected
by a flag of truce, went back to Tungchow to remonstrate against this dangerous violation of the agreement;
they were treacherously seized and thrust into loathsome dungeons, crowded
with filthy Chinese prisoners, where thirteen out of twenty-six of them died from
savage ill-treatment by their captors.

<p>Not till then did Lord Elgin learn

must be inflicted, but not according to the traditional custom of reprisals, by inflicting torture and
death on the persons of individuals. No doubt the Chinese
officials would have handed over to him as many vicarious
victims as he chose to demand, but Lord Elgin decreed
such a monumental act of indignation as should never be
effaced from the memory of the people of China. The
Summer Palace was the most precious possession of the
Heavenly Dynasty. Therein had been stored the best of
the art treasures of many generations; the ingenuity of
architects, gardeners, and craftsmen of all kinds had been
exhausted in erecting and decorating its courts and pagodas
and laying out the fantastic grounds. Lord Elgin ordered
its total destruction.

The French and English soldiers were

then the whole vast edifice was delivered to the flames.
A monument was set up on the site, bearing an inscription

national cruelty and treachery. A Convention between

troops on November 5.</p>

<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The American Civil War.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
It was not to be expected that such a convulsion among people of
British speech and descent could run its course without taking effect on a country so
intimately associated with the United States as Great Britain was in commerce, literature, and social
relations. The first difficulty arose out of the question whether the Southern States&mdash;the Confederates,
as they were designated&mdash;should receive recognition as belligerents, or whether they should be regarded
as rebels against the Federal Government. Lord John Russell, having consulted the law officers of
the Crown, announced on May 8 that the Government had decided to recognise the belligerency of
the Southern Confederation, and a proclamation of neutrality was issued on May 13. This act was
interpreted as unfriendly by the Federal Government, who claimed that no State in the Union
had a constitutional right to secede, that it could only rebel, and that the British Government had
unduly favoured the rebels by prohibiting Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects from enlisting in the service of
either Federals or Confederates. On the other hand, the Northern or Federal Government had
proclaimed the blockade of the Southern ports, thereby implying that Confederates were belligerents
and not rebels, for no Government can <i>blockade</i> its own ports, it can only <i>close</i> them. So far,
therefore, from favouring the Confederate cause by recognising its belligerency, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government
adopted the only course enabling them to respect the Federal blockade and to restrain English
traders from breaking it.</p>

<p class="clearright">An unfortunate incident arose early in the war to
intensify this feeling, and the corresponding unpopularity
of the Federals in England. Jefferson Davis, President
of the Confederate States, being anxious to obtain recognition
by European Courts, sent two Envoys, Mr. Mason to
represent him at the Court of St. James&rsquo;s, and Mr. Slidell
at the Court of the Tuileries. These two gentlemen,
escaping by night from Charleston, then under blockade,
embarked at Havana in the English mail steamer <i>Trent</i>.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The &ldquo;Trent&rdquo; Affair.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
A Federal sloop-of-war was cruising
about in search of the Confederate
privateer <i>Sumter</i>, and her commander, Captain Wilkes,
on hearing about the Confederate Envoys, resolved to get
possession of them. Intercepting the <i>Trent</i> in the
Bahama Channel, he hailed her to heave to, fired
a couple of shots across her bows, boarded her,
and carried off Messrs. Mason and Slidell. Of
course this act was wholly unjustifiable by international
law, and President Lincoln at once directed
Mr. Seward to reply by complying with Earl
Russell&rsquo;s demand for the surrender of the Confederate
Envoys. They were liberated accordingly on
January 1, 1862, and sailed for Europe. But unluckily
Lord Palmerston had no reason to calculate
on this ready compliance with British demands.
Captain Wilkes had received approval of his conduct
from the Federal Secretary to the Navy, a
vote of thanks to him had been passed by the
Washington House of Representatives, and he had
been fêted wherever he went. All this was taken
as indicating President Lincoln&rsquo;s intention to defend
the action of his officer: indeed, but for what
was going on in England, Lincoln&rsquo;s best intentions
might have been overborne by the tide of public
opinion. Simultaneously with the despatch of Lord
John Russell&rsquo;s demand for the surrender of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
prisoners, 8,000 troops were embarked in England for service in Canada, and every preparation was
made for immediate war. This not only cost Great Britain about a million of money, but also
deprived President Lincoln&rsquo;s act of all grace in the eyes of English people.</p>

<p>The colony of New South Wales, originally comprising the eastern half of the continent of Australia and the island of Tasmania, was formally founded by an
expedition under the command of Capt. Arthur Phillip. The first landing was effected at Botany Bay, and the City of Sydney was founded on January 26, 1788.
New South Wales became a self-governing colony in 1855. Population (1893), 1,277,870; imports (1895), £15,992,415; exports (1895), £21,934,785.</p>

<p>The <i>Trent</i> difficulty was the last public question in which the Prince Consort was to take part.
A memorandum dated December 1, 1861, written by him and conveying to Lord Russell the Queen&rsquo;s
remarks on the drafts of despatches he
was about to forward to Lord Lyons,
was the last State paper to which the
Prince Consort set his hand.
He had been ill for some days previously, and
soon afterwards gastric fever developed
itself. In spite of the tender attention
of the Queen and the Princesses, the
malady continued,
not much worse,
apparently, but no better.

<p class="alone in0 center">THE QUEEN AND PRINCE CONSORT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Prince died in his forty-third year.
It is pretty well understood by this time
how well he had discharged the duties of
a difficult station as Consort of the Crown,
how true was the love which united him to the Queen, how deep was her sorrow at parting with him
after twenty-one years of wedded life. He had lived down the prejudice which undoubtedly was
prevalent at the time of, and for some years after, the marriage. Without appearing in political affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
with such prominence as might have aroused the susceptibilities of a self-governing people, his attention
to public affairs was as incessant as that of any Cabinet Minister. The writing tables of the Queen
and the Prince stood side by side; he was ever at hand to advise Her Majesty in her correspondence
with Ministers; many of her letters and memoranda to the Cabinet are in the Prince&rsquo;s handwriting.
When the final solution of the <i>Trent</i> dispute was communicated to Her Majesty on January 9, 1862,
she wrote to the Prime Minister: &ldquo;Lord Palmerston cannot but look on this peaceful issue of the
American quarrel as greatly owing to
her beloved Prince, who wrote the
observations on the draft to Lord
Lyons, in which Lord Palmerston so
entirely concurred. It was the last
thing he ever wrote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only danger to the Prince
Consort&rsquo;s place in the affections of
the British people in his later years
was of the nature of that which over-took
Aristides. There is a certain
monotony in virtue, like that of uninterrupted
serene weather, which weighs
upon natures of a less lofty tenour.
But no sooner was the Prince departed
than the nation realised the value of
the part he had performed, and it
has never since ceased to be grateful
for the energy he displayed in promoting
every scheme of social or
intellectual advancement, and stimulating
the growth of commercial and
industrial enterprise.</p>

<p>The next controversy endangering
friendly relations between the
Governments of Queen Victoria and
President Lincoln arose out of Confederate
privateering. Many of the
private dockyards of Great Britain
were turning out vessels as fast as
they could to sell to the Confederate leaders.
One of these ships, the
<i>Alabama</i>, built
in Messrs. Laird&rsquo;s yard at Birkenhead,
became the terror of Federal
commerce, having captured between sixty and seventy merchantmen in two years. At last she was
sunk by the Federal ship-of-war <i>Kearsarge</i>, but her fame did not perish with her; it was the cause of an
important alteration in international law. The fact is, the <i>Alabama</i> was, for all intents and purposes, an
English pirate. Built and armed in England, most of her crew and all her gunners were English, some
of the latter being actually in English pay, as belonging to the Royal Naval Reserve. She approached
her prizes flying the British colours at her peak, and only hauled them down when her prey could
not escape. She was constantly in English harbours, and never in a Confederate one. While she was
being built at Birkenhead, the American Minister appealed in vain to the British Government to detain
her under the Foreign Enlistment Act; she was allowed to go to sea. Later on, two ironclads were
on the point of leaving the Mersey for the Confederate service. Again Mr. Adams, the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Minister, demanded their detention, adding in his letter to Lord Russell, &ldquo;it would be superfluous in
me to point out to your lordship that <i>this is war</i>.&rdquo; The ironclads were detained, but President
Lincoln, Earl Russell, and Lord Palmerston had all passed away before the dispute about the
<i>Alabama</i> was brought to a close. The American civil war had ended, General Grant was President
of the United States, and Mr. Gladstone Prime Minister of
England, when the question came up for final settlement.
When it had been raised first, Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s Government
had refused to admit any responsibility; then followed
Lord Derby&rsquo;s third administration in 1866, and Lord Stanley
as Foreign Secretary consented to the proposal for arbitration.
But the introduction of various claims on the part of
private individuals, arising out of events long antecedent to
the civil war caused the postponement of any agreement
until the year 1871. Each nation then appointed a Commission
to meet at Washington to discuss all the subjects
of international controversy, of which the <i>Alabama</i> claims
were the principal. The British Commissioners were Earl
de Grey (the present Marquis of Ripon), Sir Stafford Northcote
(afterwards Earl of Iddesleigh), Mr. Montague Bernard,
Sir Edward Thornton, British Ambassador at Washington,
and Sir John Macdonald, Prime Minister of the Canadian
Parliament. The Conference resulted in the Treaty of
Washington, of which the opening clause gave occasion to
considerable resentment in the minds of the British public.
It was no less than an apology&mdash;dignified but explicit&mdash;on
the part of the Queen&rsquo;s Government, for having permitted
the escape of the <i>Alabama</i> and other cruisers from British
ports, to the injury of American commerce. England, it was
loudly protested, had never apologised to any other Power;
she would never had been so humiliated had &ldquo;Old Pam&rdquo; remained at the head of affairs; the whole
British case had been given away before the matter got to the stage of arbitration. So said the
British Press, and so said a large section of the public. However, Great Britain having professed
herself ready to pay something to secure the friendship of President Grant&rsquo;s Government, the claims
went before a tribunal of five arbitrators, of whom one was appointed by Queen Victoria, and one
each by President Grant, the King of Italy, the Emperor of Brazil, and the President of the Swiss
Confederation. This tribunal assembled at
Geneva in 1872, and decreed that Great Britain
should pay an indemnity of £3,250,000
for the acts of the <i>Alabama</i> and other
Confederate cruisers. The fine was paid,
but the impression produced on the minds
of the British people cannot be said to
have been favourable to the doctrine of
arbitration. It was felt that John Bull had
been made to &ldquo;knuckle down&rdquo; to Brother
Jonathan, and the amicable intentions of the
British Commissioners at Washington of promoting
cordial relations between the British
and American peoples were frustrated almost
as thoroughly as they might have been had
the dispute been fought out in the ordinary
way.</p>

<p>On March 10, 1863, took place the marriage of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, to the Princess
Alexandra<a name="FNanchor_H" id="FNanchor_H"></a><a href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a>, eldest daughter of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg, heir to

<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Marriage of the Prince of Wales.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The announcement of the betrothal had been favourably
received in Great Britain, but, on the arrival of the bride-elect in London, her
exceeding personal beauty, her charm of manner and amiability, produced a
remarkable effect, and public feeling rose to a very high degree of enthusiastic approval. London
hastened to cover up the dingy traces of an English winter with gay bunting; the lively Danish
national colours, scarlet and white, draped all the thoroughfares; and everywhere might be seen the
Dannebrog&mdash;the national ensign of Denmark&mdash;streaming side by side with the British standard in the
keen wind and bright sunshine of March.</p>

<p>Her Majesty the Queen occupies the royal closet above the group of bridesmaids. Next the Prince of Wales are his supporters, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and the Crown Prince of Prussia. The Archbishop of
Canterbury and Dean Wellesley officiate. The bridesmaids were the Ladies Victoria Scott, Diana Beauclerk, Elena Bruce, Victoria Howard, Emily Villiers, Agneta Yorke, Feodore Wellesley, and Emily Hare. The English Princes and
Princesses are to the left of the bridal group; the mother and sisters of the bride to the right.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The course of events on the Continent at this time gave to the royal marriage an appearance
of political significance which, in reality, it did not possess. In olden times, no doubt, the espousal
of the heir of England to the daughter of Denmark would have implied a political and military
alliance, offensive and defensive, between the two Crowns. But in Europe of the nineteenth century
it is peoples, not princes, who hold the decrees of peace and war. It was this very fact which,
shortly after the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s marriage, seemed likely to precipitate a conflict between Great
Britain and Denmark on the one side, and Austria and Prussia on the other. Englishmen had grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>proud of their beautiful Princess, and were chivalrously disposed to take up the cause of her little
country. They forgot or did not know that it was only the adopted country of her family.</p>

<p>The crisis arose on the death of Frederick VII.,
King of Denmark. The succession, as had been decreed
by the Great Powers in 1852, devolved on the
father of the Princess of Wales, who became King
Christian IX. of Denmark.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Schleswig-Holstein Difficulty.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
There had existed
between Germany and Denmark a long-standing dispute
about the possession of the
Duchies of Schleswig, Holstein,
and Lauenburg.
The King of
Denmark was also Duke of Holstein and Lauenburg,
just as, previous to Queen Victoria&rsquo;s accession, the
King of England had been also King of Hanover.
But the vast majority of the population of these
Duchies was purely German, and the German Confederation
had been anxious for a long time to admit
them to their common nationality. The Danish
Government, on the other hand, desired to incorporate
these provinces in the Kingdom of Denmark.
Prince Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein-Augustenburg
disputed the
succession of Christian IX. to the
Duchies in question. The Germanic
Diet, under the influence of Herr
von Bismarck, supported Prince
Frederick&rsquo;s claim, and an allied
army, provided by Austria and
Prussia, crossed the frontiers of
Holstein and Schleswig to enforce
it. The Danish army was mobilised,
and Denmark entered upon a
hopeless contest&mdash;hopeless, seeing
that she, one of the weakest of
European States, was pitted against
two of the most powerful.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the
Danes had not unreasonable grounds
for believing they would not be left
to meet such odds single-handed.
Lord Russell had often warned the
Danish Government that unless it
respected the liberty of its German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
subjects, Denmark must look for no help from England in a conflict with the Germanic Powers.
The Danes protested that they had scrupulously followed this advice, and there can be no doubt
that they had been encouraged to look for the
support of Great Britain if any attempt were
made to infringe legitimate Danish authority,
and that both Lord Russell and Lord Palmerston
contemplated armed intervention between
Denmark and her possible aggressors as a
duty which Great Britain might have to undertake.
But Great Britain had too much at stake
to risk a conflict single-handed with Austria and
Prussia, who, as Lord Palmerston wrote to Lord
Russell, &ldquo;could bring 200,000 or 300,000 men
into the field.&rdquo; England was not more bound
by the Treaty of Vienna than France was; France
refused to act, and England adopted the prudent, but apparently cold-blooded, part of looker-on. Public
opinion in Great Britain ran pretty high in favour of the Danes, and many Englishmen felt ashamed
of the part their country was made to play. They could not understand how Palmerston, of all men,
could act so unhandsomely, and perhaps the only thing that saved the Government from defeat on a
vote of censure, was that Disraeli, who moved it, shrank from advocating the only logical alternative
to their policy&mdash;a declaration of war.</p>

age of six years and thirty-six days.

The chief feature of the general election
which followed was
the number of seats gained
by the Radicals at the expense of the remnants
of the Whig party or Moderate Liberals.
Mr. Gladstone, reckoned as a Liberal-Conservative
up to this time, though
well known to be inclining more and
more to the policy typified by John
Bright, was unseated for Oxford University
by Mr. Gathorne-Hardy (now
Earl of Cranbrook), and the last tie which attached him to the Conservatives was severed by his
subsequent election for South Lancashire.</p>

<p>Palmerston&rsquo;s appeal to the country had been answered by an expression of confidence in him,
but that confidence was of a very complex kind. The Radicals voted for him, because, as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
he was in Parliament, no other man could lead the Liberal party; but they distrusted his foreign
policy, and chafed at his indifference to questions of reform. The Liberals voted for him, because
he represented exactly the views of moderate Liberalism; and the attitude of many Conservatives
was accurately expressed in a letter written by Mr. W. H. Smith, Liberal-Conservative candidate
for Westminster, to Colonel Taylor, the Whip of the Conservative party, thanking him for the support
he had received from Conservatives in his unsuccessful contest against Mr. Mill. &ldquo;I believe in
Lord Palmerston,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and look forward ultimately to a fusion of the moderate men following
Lord Derby and Lord Palmerston into a strong Liberal-Conservative party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the strong link which for so long had bound the present to the past, and acted as a check
on precipitate legislation, snapped at last.
Palmerston died on October 18, 1865, aged eighty-one
years, less two days, having
sat in the House of Commons
for fifty-eight years,
which, as Mr. Cardwell observed, was just one-tenth
of its whole existence. The feeling in
the country was more profound than any
which had been manifested since the death of
Wellington. In the course of these pages no
attempt has been made to palliate or conceal
some of the errors of judgment, the faults of
statesmanship, even the occasional want of
sincerity to Parliament and the public
which formed blemishes in his career,
especially in the earlier part of the
Queen&rsquo;s reign. In spite of these blots&mdash;and
some of them were far from
venial&mdash;he had lived to secure the confidence
of his Sovereign and the affection
of her people. A great deal of
this was owing to his personal character
and manner and his kindly humour. It
is no slight upon Scotsmen or Irishmen
to say that the chief secret of his
universal popularity was that he was
such a thorough Englishman. Some
of his sayings had a much deeper
meaning than their tone of levity implied. Two of them will bear repetition here, seeing how accurately
the lapse of years has fulfilled the prediction contained in them. Palmerston was known to be opposed
to any further extension of the franchise. Somebody once observed to him that it really would not make
much difference, for the same class of member would be returned as before. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Palmerston,
&ldquo;the same men will get in as before, but they will play to the shilling gallery instead of to the boxes.&rdquo;
The late Earl of Shaftesbury put on record one of Palmerston&rsquo;s latest sayings. Palmerston always
distrusted Mr. Gladstone as a politician, and made no secret of it. But he always was extremely
anxious for Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s return for Oxford University. &ldquo;He is a dangerous man,&rdquo; he said to Lord
Shaftesbury: &ldquo;keep him in Oxford, and he is partially muzzled, but send him elsewhere, and he will run
wild.&rdquo; This came to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s ears, so, after his defeat at Oxford in 1865, he opened his campaign
in South Lancashire by saying to the electors assembled in the Free Trade Hall of Manchester:
&ldquo;At last, my friends, I have come amongst you.... I am come among you unmuzzled.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="dropleft">T</span>HE only changes in the old Cabinet, consequent on the death of its great chief, were
the advance of Earl Russell to the Premiership and the appointment of Lord Clarendon
to the Foreign Office. But the change in the House of Commons was as momentous
as it was abrupt. The place of its old
leader&mdash;the safe, the leisurely, the unemotional
Palmerston&mdash;was filled by the restless and
ardent, the uncertain Gladstone. The Conservatives
were dispirited and anxious; they were afraid of what
the new House of Commons might be led to do; party
feeling began to acquire a new bitterness, the offspring
of fear, which was to grow more and more intense
until the final retirement of Mr. Gladstone in 1895.
The Radicals, on the other hand, were sanguine and
jubilant. Reinforced in numbers, and relieved from the
restraint which the irresistible prestige of Palmerston
had imposed on their aspirations, they felt that the
moment for action had come; they had got a leader
after their own hearts, and the first thing to do was to
extend the franchise. But there was disappointment in
store for them. Mr. Gladstone introduced his Bill on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
March 12; it pleased nobody. The Radicals detected in it the frigid hand of the Whigs, and the
moderate Liberals, secretly detesting all schemes for a Democratic franchise, began by viewing it
coldly, and gradually drifted into opposition
with the Conservatives. Its most
formidable opponent rose from the Ministerial
Benches. Mr. Robert Lowe, whom
an intimate acquaintance with Australasian
politics had imbued with profound
distrust for Democratic institutions, made
a brilliant and fearless onslaught on the
measure, and received all that rapturous
applause which is the invariable reward
of a strong man turning his weapons
against his own party. Gradually he
drew to himself a compact band of malcontents,
whose memory might have
passed into oblivion long ere this but
for a happy metaphor employed by Mr.
John Bright, who likened them to the
men who gathered to
David in the Cave of Adullam.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Cave of Adullam.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
&ldquo;Every one that was in distress,
and every one that was in debt,
and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him.&rdquo; People were tickled with the
illustration: straightway the Liberal dissentients were dubbed Adullamites, and &ldquo;a cave&rdquo; has remained
ever since the recognised term for a group of men combining to act against their own party.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowe&rsquo;s band proved strong enough to kill the measure. It passed the second reading, indeed,
by a majority of five, but it perished in Committee, and the Ministry resigned. It was the closing
scene of Earl Russell&rsquo;s long career, which somehow had missed the success which his achievements
seemed to have earned. Born in the very holiest of holies of the Whig sanctuary, with natural
abilities far more varied, with acquired culture far more extensive, with greater advantages from
family connection than Palmerston could boast, and without Palmerston&rsquo;s headstrong tendencies,
he never attained more than a fraction of the influence and popularity which Palmerston had
so fully secured. Indispensable for more than a generation to every Whig or Liberal Cabinet, he had
become associated more with the failures than the successes of his party, and people ungratefully
remembered him rather as the betrayer of Denmark than as the pioneer of Reform.</p>

country vehemently demanding Reform. It was too late in the session, of course, to do anything that
year in Parliament, but the agitation sufficed to show that there was at least one weak man in the
Cabinet. The Reform League summoned a meeting in Hyde Park for the evening of July 23, which
it was decided to prohibit, and amiable, gentle Mr. Walpole, the Home Secretary, issued a notice
that the Park gates would be closed at 5 p.m. Notwithstanding this announcement, processions
with bands and banners arrived at the appointed hour, and Mr. Beales, President of the League,
demanded admittance, which was refused. Mr. Beales was an experienced barrister, and knew very
well what he was about. He was of opinion that in denying the right of public meeting in Hyde
Park, the Home Secretary was acting beyond his powers, and, content with asserting this right in a
formal way, he intended to adjourn the meeting and claim redress by constitutional means. But a
meeting in Hyde Park, no matter for what purpose, invariably attracts thousands of idlers and roughs,
who have no part and no interest in the question to be discussed. Mr. Beales and the earnest
reformers adjourned to Trafalgar Square and passed resolutions to their hearts&rsquo; content; but the
rough and idle part of the crowd remained about Hyde Park. The gates were strong enough to
resist any pressure, but the railings were old and frail.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Disturbance in Hyde Park.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
People climbing on them felt them shake
and creak; half a dozen fellows gave a push together in Park Lane&mdash;the railings
gave way; in an instant the whole length from Hamilton Gardens to the Marble
Arch went down, and the Park was filled with a tumultuous, rollicking mob. The
grass and the flower-beds were the only property that suffered; the police took a few prisoners, and
the crowd dispersed peacefully at nightfall. Mr. Beales took a small deputation to the Home Secretary
next day, urging him to withdraw the troops and police, and trust the people to take care of the
town. Mr. Walpole consented; it may have been prudent to do so, but the manner of doing it
was unfortunate. It is a dangerous precedent for a Home Secretary to show himself afraid of the
consequence of carrying out his own decrees.</p>

The summer of 1866 will be remembered long in the City of London by reason of the commercial

result of active trade and the new law of limited liability.

The suspension early
in May of the great discount firm of Overend and Gurney, with liabilities figured

of the Bank Charter Act. On May 11 the Bank rate was raised to 10 per cent. and continued at
that point till August 17. The shock was one from which the credit of the country took a long time
to recover, and the amount of private misfortune and loss of income reacted on almost every department
of trade, though the public revenue maintained a surprising degree of elasticity.</p>

<p>A brighter passage in the record of 1866 is that which commemorates the completion of telegraphic
communication between Great Britain and America. Attempts had been made in 1857, 1858, and 1865
to lay a cable across the Atlantic, all of which ended in failure; but Mr. Cyrus Field would not
abandon his dream.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Atlantic Cable.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
 The <i>Great Eastern</i> steamship sailed from Berehaven on July 12, and on July 27
the first messages were exchanged between the old and new worlds. A feat hardly
less inspiring was performed later in the same season, in the recovery of the broken
cable of 1865, which was spliced, thereby effecting a second connection between the two continents.</p>

<p>Mr. Disraeli, as has been said, had undertaken the task in which Mr. Gladstone had failed,
and brought in a Reform Bill early in the session of 1867. It cost the Government a heavy
price at the outset: Lord Carnarvon, Lord Cranbourne (now Marquis of Salisbury), and General
Peel resigned their seats in the Cabinet because they disapproved of it. The Bill went forward,
and, after undergoing many changes, finally passed in a form conferring household suffrage in
boroughs and a £12 franchise in counties.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>&ldquo;A Leap in the Dark.&rdquo;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Lord Derby on the third reading of the
Bill in the Lords, quoting a remark made by Lord Cranbourne in the other House, &ldquo;no doubt we
are making a great experiment and &lsquo;taking a leap in the dark,&rsquo; but I have the
greatest confidence in the sound sense of my fellow-countrymen.&rdquo; But another
saying by Lord Derby gives a truer insight into the real object of a Conservative Government in
doing work so repugnant to its accredited principles. Somebody having observed to him that the
measure was dangerously democratic&mdash;&ldquo;We have dished the Whigs!&rdquo; was all that Derby replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Mr. Disraeli, in reference to the same subject, made use of a phrase which gave bitter offence to
some of his party, and deepened the distrust with which the old school of Conservatives regarded
him almost to the end of his life. On October 29, 1867, he was entertained at a banquet by the
Conservatives of Edinburgh, and when passing in review the events of the session, and especially his
Reform Act, he said: &ldquo;I had to prepare the mind of the country, and to educate&mdash;if it be not
arrogant to use such a phrase&mdash;to educate our party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stream of emigration westward which set in after the Irish famine in 1848 had resulted in
creating a very large Irish population in the United States. All these emigrants had brought with
them a bitter hatred of England, on whom they laid the blame of all the sufferings of their own people.
They had found in America the true
remedy for their wrongs, which, had
they realised it, arose not so much
from political, as from physical causes.
By moving to a spacious land where
labour was in demand, they escaped
from the evils which must always press
upon a congested population with no
proper outlet for its energy. But still
they loved old Ireland and hated
England, and, finding themselves of
political importance in the new land,
for the Irish vote soon became indispensable
to the Democratic party, they
busied themselves with projects for the
deliverance of their country. They found
plenty of encouragement from Americans,
for the feeling in the Northern
States was very bitter against England
after the close of the civil war. Thousands
of Irishmen had learnt the art
of war and the use of weapons in the
Federal armies; a military organisation
was set on foot in the belief that Great
Britain and the United States were on
the point of going to war.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Fenians.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This organisation, which adopted the title of Fenian, had for its
leader a man of great ability and experience, James Stephens. The Government
received due warning of what was in preparation; in fact, the leaders of
the movement in Ireland openly proclaimed their intention of restoring by force of arms the
independence of Ireland. They had plenty of funds: every Irish man and maid in America contributed
something to such a glorious purpose. A steady stream of American-Irish, most of them
old soldiers of the civil war, set in from across the Atlantic, and scattered themselves among the towns
and villages of Ireland. At last Stephens himself arrived, who, having been mixed up in the rising of
1848, was promptly arrested and lodged in Richmond Prison, Dublin, in November, 1865. All Ireland
was convulsed with delight when, a few days later, he was found to have escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
The absence of Stephens from America had evil results to the Fenians there. One party was
for invading Canada, a project which Stephens had never favoured. No sooner was his back turned,
than a party of Fenians actually
crossed the Niagara river, occupied
a fort, and defeated a force
of Canadian volunteers. Just as
in 1838, when the Canadians
were in revolt, the United States
Government had saved the position
for Great Britain by enforcing
the neutrality of their
frontier, so now it acted a
similar part, and put an end
to what might have become a
highly dangerous state of affairs.
Stephens never reappeared, but
the preparations he had started
were continued. With the pathetic
hero-worship of the Celt,
the Irish peasantry were confident
that their lost leader would
return among them soon and lead
them to victory. But one brief
taste of prison discipline had been enough for this doughty champion, and he is believed to have spent
the rest of his life abroad in comparative affluence, derived from the subscriptions collected from his dupes.</p>

<p>The first body of immigrants arrived at Port Nicholson in 1840. In the same year the whole of the islands
were annexed by Great Britain, and Wellington and Auckland were founded. Constitutional government was
conferred in 1853. In 1865 Wellington became the seat of government. The population of the islands in

<p>In February 1867 the Government frustrated a Fenian plot to seize Chester Castle; there was an
attempt at a general rising in Ireland, which ended in the loss of a few lives in harebrained and disconnected
attacks on police barracks in Cork, Limerick,
Louth, and elsewhere, and a number of American-Irish
were arrested. Two of these prisoners were
being conveyed across Manchester in a prison
van, when it was suddenly attacked by a party of
armed Fenians. A policeman was shot dead, the
prisoners were rescued and were never recaptured.</p>

<p>The only other serious act of the Fenians

afternoon, throwing down about sixty yards of masonry and wrecking several houses in the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
But for a warning received by the Governor of the gaol that an attempt was to be made to blow it
up, the prisoners would have been at exercise in the yard at the time of the explosion, and almost
certainly must have been killed. As it was, twelve persons were
killed and 120 were wounded.</p>

<p>The arms of a great and growing empire are seldom allowed
to rust from disuse, no matter how pacific the intentions of its
rulers may be. Parliament was called together in November 1867
to vote supplies for an Expedition which it had been found
necessary to send out to Abyssinia, under the command of Sir
Robert Napier. Theodore, King of Abyssinia,
a passionate and semi-barbarous despot, had
cultivated amicable relations with Great Britain for a number of
years, chiefly on account of his friendship for Mr. Plowden, formerly
English Consul at Massowah. But Mr. Plowden was dead&mdash;killed
in an encounter between Theodore and his rebellious subjects; and
Captain Cameron, who succeeded to the Consulate at Massowah,
had not succeeded in ingratiating himself with the King. Theodore
appealed to Queen Victoria to help him against the Turks, and on
receiving no immediate reply to his letter, lost his temper and
threw all the British subjects he could catch into the cavernous
dungeons of his capital, Magdala. Among these captives was
Captain Cameron. Mr. Rassam was sent on an embassy to remonstrate
with Theodore, who, however, was not inclined to
listen to reason. On the contrary, he had the envoy seized,
with his companions, Lieutenant Prideaux and Dr. Blane, loaded
with chains, and thrust into prison. Lord Stanley now sent to
demand the release of the prisoners within three months, and
declared that immediate invasion would follow if this were refused. It was a delicate business to
convey despatches to the tyrant in his rock fortress, and Theodore never received the ultimatum.
The expedition set out: 400 miles of
very mountainous country had to be
traversed, but everything had been
admirably prepared in the matter of
transport and commissariat, and Napier
was an experienced commander. The
ease of the victory which awaited him
has done something to diminish the
fame which is really his due for accomplishing
a very difficult task. He encountered
the Abyssinian army under
the walls of Magdala on April 10, 1868;
the King&rsquo;s soldiers fought with headlong
gallantry, and fell in heaps before the
terrible fire of British Infantry. Charge
after charge was repelled, until Napier
found that his enemy had vanished,
leaving some 2,000 dead and wounded
on the field, while in his own force the
casualties amounted to no more than
nineteen wounded. The fierce old King
so far bowed under chastisement that the captives were released, but he refused to surrender. It
then became necessary to enforce the lesson that, if Great Britain does not take up arms lightly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
neither does she lay them down without exacting all her demands. Napier determined to take
Magdala by assault. Perched high on a precipitous rock, it occupied a position which, in old times
and without modern appliances, must have been pronounced inaccessible. But there are few
places to which courage equipped by science can be denied admission: the northern gate was
stormed, and lying within it was found the old lion King. Preferring death to dishonour he had
perished by his own hand.</p>

Disraeli had succeeded, and he was not

<p>In choosing the Established Protestant
Church of Ireland for attack, Mr.
Gladstone selected the weakest spot in the
Constitution; one, nevertheless, which the
Conservative party were bound to defend
to their last man.
The Irish peasantry,
except those of the greater part of Ulster,
were Roman Catholics, and Roman Catholics
of a peculiarly devout and enthusiastic
kind. The Protestant Establishment was an alien Church, and could never be anything else; a
monument of conquest which it had been unwise to set up. It presented itself to Mr. Gladstone as
the very core and pillar of disaffection, and it was very easy to make out a strong case for its abolition.
In March 1868 he brought forward three resolutions, declaring that it was the opinion of the
House of Commons that the Established Church of Ireland should cease to exist, and the first division
showed a majority of sixty-one in favour of the project and against the Government. In consequence
of this Disraeli advised the Queen to dissolve Parliament, which was done in July. Writs were made
returnable in November, and the interval was spent in such canvassing and platform work as the
country had never experienced before.

showing a majority for them of 120 in the New Parliament. Mr. Gladstone,

forming a Ministry.

The most notable accession to the Cabinet was that of Mr. Bright, who became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Secretary of State for India, thus marking an epoch in Parliamentary history by the formal recognition
of the extreme Radicals as a party in the State. The great business of the session of 1869 was, of
course, the Bill to disestablish and disendow the Irish Church. No
Irish question can be touched without releasing the springs of oratory
of a quality beside which the most impassioned appeals of average
English or Scottish speakers seem tame and halting. In the Commons
the fight was a foregone conclusion; but the Irish Church was an
exceedingly wealthy corporation, and the disposal of its possessions,
to the value of sixteen millions sterling, afforded matter for long and
complicated debates in Committee. The Lords could not be persuaded
even to delay the Act on which the country and the House
of Commons had spoken with so much decision. The Bill passed
its second reading by a majority of thirty-three, and received the
Royal Assent on July 26, 1869. Lord Derby had made his last speech
on the second reading of this measure, which he resisted with much of
his ancient vigour and all his splendid eloquence.

<p>The Irish people at first showed few signs of gratitude for the
disestablishment of their State Church. The Fenians were giving fresh
signs of activity, agrarian crime was of frightful frequency during the
winter of 1869&ndash;70, and the virulence of the anti-British press became
day by day more intense. Troops were poured into the country to
repress disturbance, and Mr. Gladstone set about preparing fresh
measures of conciliation. The Irish land system, theoretically almost
identical in general principles to that of Great Britain, not only differed from it in important
details, but had come to be worked on wholly different lines from those pursued by English and
Scottish landlords.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Irish Land Legislation.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In Great Britain the tendency had been to throw small
unprofitable holdings into substantial farms which should be worth the efforts
of energetic men of means to cultivate. The landlord, as a rule, equipped the farm with
suitable buildings and fences, and frequently lived on his estates during most of the year. In
Ireland, with few exceptions, buildings
and improvements of every sort were
executed by the tenant, who was allowed
to subdivide his holding into mere
patches of land, with a hovel run up
at the expense of the occupant. The
peasantry were bound to their holdings
by the capital they had sunk in them;
they could not in every season wring the
rent out of the land; huge masses of
arrears accumulated, often ending in
eviction, which meant practical confiscation
of such permanent improvements as
had been effected. All the evil effects
and bitter feelings arising out of this
decrepid mode of tenure were intensified
by the ever-increasing tendency of
landowners to absenteeism, and by the
prevailing difference in the religion of
proprietors and peasantry.</p>

<p>In Ulster, indeed, the
conditions were different.
Not only was there a
large Protestant element
in the farming and labouring
class, but the
custom of tenant-right
had grown up, protecting
the tenant against disturbance
as long as he
paid his rent, securing
his right to compensation
on leaving for improvements
executed by himself,
and, most important
of all, giving him a
saleable property in the
goodwill of the tenancy.
The Ulster tenantry, as
a rule, were prosperous.
Mr. Gladstone refused to
see in their prosperity only the result of their greater industry and capacity for business: he set it
down to the system of dual ownership involved in the recognition of tenant-right, and this system he
resolved to apply to every part of Ireland by creating a statutory partnership between landlord and
tenant. It is hardly possible to conceive a reform more vital than that initiated by this measure in
the social fabric of Ireland; for, except in the north-east of Ulster, agriculture forms the sole important
industry of that country. Yet the Conservative Opposition, led by Mr. Disraeli, made no attempt to
resist it; the case for legislation was too clamant.</p>

<p>Far-reaching as the Irish Land Bill has proved in its effects, it was hardly of greater moment
than a measure introduced two days later by Mr. W. E. Forster, establishing a scheme of elementary education.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>National Education.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Government had been not more than two years in office, and had
amply fulfilled the first part of an ambitious programme by passing three measures
of extraordinary importance, dealing with the Irish Church, Irish land tenure, and national education;
yet the tide of popular favour which had carried them into power began to show unmistakeable signs
of ebbing. The legislation of 1871, actual and proposed, served
to add to the number of malcontents.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Army Purchase.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The first step taken was
against the system of purchase in the army.
It was the recognised practice in all except a
few special corps in the British army for an officer to purchase
his first commission, as well as every subsequent step in regimental
promotion. There was a regulation scale of prices, but there was
also an extra regulation payment, winked at by the authorities. An
officer&rsquo;s commission thus became a valuable property to him, which
he could dispose of on leaving the service. It was a system which
few people could defend successfully in theory, but it was one that
had worked well in practice; and the project to sweep it away
created a vigorous opposition. But what makes the Parliamentary
fight over army purchase of moment in history is the means by
which Mr. Gladstone carried his purpose in the teeth of the House
of Lords. The abolition of purchase had been part only of a sweeping
measure of army re-organisation brought in by Mr. Cardwell.
In order to save part of the Bill, the Government threw overboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
every section of it except the purchase clauses. The
Lords, desiring to defeat what was left of the
original Bill, declared they would not accept the
purchase clauses until the whole scheme of army
reform was before them. A sigh of relief escaped
from military men; the system endeared to them by custom and association had been saved by the
action of the Upper House. But they had to learn how resolute and adroit was he with whom they
had to reckon. Mr. Gladstone had a theatrical surprise in store for everyone. He gave the go-by
to Parliament by announcing that, whereas army purchase had been created by Royal warrant, it could
be rendered illegal by the same means; and, therefore, he had advised the Queen to cancel the old
warrant and issue a new one. It was a complete victory over the House of Lords; they were forced
to pass the Bill so obnoxious to them, otherwise the officers of the army would have been deprived
of the compensation provided for the sums they had paid for their commissions. But the victory was
very damaging to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Government.</p>

<p>Most educated people were tired, and perhaps ashamed, of the uproar and scandal inseparable from
the old system of elections, and the Government brought in a Bill to abolish the hustings and make the
proceedings more orderly, against which few voices would have been raised, had it
not contained provisions for voting by Ballot.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Ballot Bill.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The idea of secret voting was
repugnant to the national sense of what is
fair and above-board; but the Bill eventually
got through the House of Commons, though
shorn, at the instance of Mr. Vernon
Harcourt and Mr. James (now Lord James
of Hereford), of the provisions for throwing
the expenses of elections on the rates. The
measure was rejected by the House of
Lords, but the Government succeeded in
passing it during the session of 1872. The
result upon the balance of parties in the
House of Commons has been singularly
small, and certainly the Conservatives, who
had most reason to dread the effect of secret
voting on the fortunes of their party, have
had no reason to complain of the result.</p>

Nothing occurred seriously to endanger her neutrality; she was enjoying
a period of commercial prosperity strangely in contrast to
the savage strife beyond the sea, until a sudden and ominous act on the part of the Russian
Government redoubled the anxious vigilance of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government. The Treaty of Paris
had established the neutrality of the Black Sea, throwing open its waters to the mercantile
marine of all nations, and interdicting them to the flag of war, &ldquo;either of the Powers possessing
its coasts, or of any other Power.&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Russia Seizes her Opportunity.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
By this provision Russia now proclaimed she
would no longer be bound. She could not have chosen a better opportunity for
her own purpose. The Western Alliance was dislocated; two of the signatories
to the Treaty of Paris were engaged in mortal strife; a third&mdash;Austria&mdash;could not be expected to
take action independently of Prussia; was it incumbent on Great Britain&mdash;the fourth Power&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
vindicate, single-handed, the sanctity of the treaty? Few responsible people could be found to contemplate
seriously such a course; yet it was peculiarly galling to the national pride to have to acquiesce
in the action of Russia. Lord Granville proposed a conference of the Powers to be held in London,
and the proposal was accepted. The Conference met on
January 17, 1872, and solemnly proceeded to abrogate
that which they were in no position to maintain&mdash;the
neutralisation of the Black Sea. Reflection on the situation
of Europe at that time can lead to no other conclusion
but that Great Britain was sagaciously steered
without loss of honour through a very difficult channel;
but none the less unfavourable to the Government was
the impression created at the time, that the country had
suffered a degree of humiliation in permitting a treaty
which had cost her so dear to be torn up.</p>

<p>But Mr. Gladstone, full of serious purpose, was blind
to the symptoms of failing prestige&mdash;indifferent to the
warning conveyed by loss of successive seats at by-elections.

On February 13 he
introduced a Bill dealing with the
Irish Universities. It was a masterly
measure, a scheme of extraordinary
complexity, dealing with a very complicated and unsatisfactory
state of things. It is not necessary to examine
its details at this time; it is, perhaps, enough to say
that the Prime Minister&rsquo;s plan was one that, while it
offended and alarmed every one deriving benefit from the existing state of things, failed to satisfy
any of the religious bodies&mdash;Protestant, Catholic, or Non&shy;conformist&mdash;which desired a change. Disraeli&rsquo;s
words spoken on the second reading came home to many hearts on both sides of the House. &ldquo;You
have now had four years of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have despoiled
churches; you have threatened every corporation and endowment
in the country. You have examined into everybody&rsquo;s affairs.
You have criticised every profession and vexed every trade. No
one is certain of his property, and nobody
knows what duties he may have to perform
to-morrow. I believe that the people of this
country have had enough of confiscation.&rdquo;

The Bill was rejected

<p>Ministers were in an unenviable position. The increasing
bitterness of parties had brought about a disregard of those
unwritten laws which had contributed so much in the past to the
amenity of public life and to earning for the House of Commons
the character of being &ldquo;the best club in London.&rdquo; There were
bitter dissensions among Ministers themselves, of which Lord Ripon
and Mr. Childers gave evidence by leaving the Cabinet. In four
years the Conservatives had gained fifteen seats in by-elections,
against which Ministerialists could only set two captured from the
enemy. Still, the Government could reckon on a majority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
ninety in the House of Commons, and no one dreamt of their appealing to the country while all
the omens remained adverse. Nevertheless, Mr. Gladstone startled everybody by issuing a manifesto,
in January 1874, announcing the dissolution of Parliament.

<p>The closing months of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Administration were marked by a short war on the Gold
Coast, arising out of a dispute with Koffee Calcalli, King of Ashanti, who had claimed a tribute
formerly paid to him by the Dutch for some territory which they sold to Great Britain in 1872.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Ashanti War.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Failing to obtain acknowledgment of his claim, the King of
Ashanti attacked the Fantis, a tribe under British protection, and it became necessary to chastise him.
The difficulty of doing so lay, not in the character of the people of Ashanti, for, though brave and
warlike, they could not stand before modern arms of precision, but in the nature of the climate and
the difficulty of transport. The campaign had to be limited to the cool season; it was entrusted to
Sir Garnet Wolseley, who well sustained the reputation he had earned in the Red River Expedition in
1870. The Expedition left England on September 12, 1873, and returned on March 21, 1874, having
in the interval captured and destroyed Coomassie, the capital, brought the King to terms, and
laid a perpetual interdict on the hideous human sacrifices which formed one of his most cherished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
institutions. The Ashanti warriors defended their forest roads gallantly, and the British loss was
heavy in proportion to the numbers engaged. The total cost of this Expedition was reckoned at a
little short of one million sterling.</p>

during which the Liberal leadership was administered by a kind of <i>junta</i>, the Marquis of Hartington
assumed the thankless task of leading the deserted and dispirited Opposition, an office made all the
more difficult by the occasional raids upon the debates made by Mr. Gladstone as often as some
subject which specially interested him turned up, such as the Public Worship Bill, and the Bill

<p>Mr. Disraeli was not new to office, but he found himself in power for the first time. With a good
working majority behind him in the House of Commons, a helpless Opposition before him, and a
surplus of six millions at the Treasury, the natural question in everybody&rsquo;s mouth was &ldquo;What will he
do with it?&rdquo; There were still many of his own party who mistrusted his love of display and his
magnificent conception of empire as likely to impel him along some hazardous course of conquest abroad

<p>But towards the end of 1875 there came the occasion for the display of some spirit, in which
may be traced the beginning of reaction against the &ldquo;Little Britain&rdquo; school of politicians. When
a singular opportunity presented itself of strengthening our communications
with the East, Disraeli fearlessly seized it. The Suez
Canal had been open since 1869, and Great Britain, though she
was the Power which made most use of it, had no pecuniary
interest in it. The funds necessary for the work had been subscribed
almost entirely by the Egyptian Government and by private
speculators in France. Of the 400,000 original shares, the Khedive
of Egypt held 176,000; but the Khedive&rsquo;s expenditure had been
for years far beyond his revenues, and his shares were thrown
upon the market in 1875.
Disraeli was struck by the proposition
advanced by Mr. Greenwood, a journalist of some note, that these
shares should be bought by the British Government,
and the purchase was completed on
November 25, the price paid being £4,000,000.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Suez Canal Shares.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Sir Stafford Northcote, on whom fell the duty of asking Parliament for the
money, was opposed to his chief&rsquo;s policy in this matter, and
must have felt some misgiving in repelling the attacks made
upon it by the Liberals, but he
did so effectively. Mr. Gladstone
emerged from his retirement to
fling himself into the debate, and
declared that to spend the national
funds in such an object was &ldquo;an
unprecedented thing&rdquo;;&mdash;&ldquo;So is the Canal!&rdquo; retorted Northcote. It
is only just to Disraeli&rsquo;s statesmanship to notice what an excellent
investment, in a monetary sense, was made for Great Britain by the
purchase of these shares. The original sum of four millions has been
entirely paid off out of income derived from the shares, which, for a
number of years, have been paying from 17 to 21 per cent. The shares
purchased have risen
in value from four
to eighteen millions,
and the proportion
of British tonnage
to the whole tonnage
of all nations
using the Canal is
75 per cent. It
would, however, be
claiming too much
for Disraeli&rsquo;s commercial
acumen to
suppose that he
realised what should
become the ultimate
monetary value of
these shares. What
he perceived was the importance of Great Britain acquiring a voice in the management of
the new and dominant highway to India. The public had received recently the means of estimating
the stupendous responsibility resting on the shoulders of those charged with the administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
of British India. The results of the first census ever taken there were published in 1875,
showing the total population of the British dominion in India to consist of twenty-three distinct
nationalities, amounting to 190,563,048 souls&mdash;nearly five times
that of the United Kingdom. This did much to dispel an
idea dimly present in the minds even of educated persons,
that the Queen&rsquo;s Indian subjects consisted of one dusky
race, speaking one language and divided into two religions&mdash;Mahomedan and Hindoo.</p>

There was less unanimity in the reception of the next important proposal

rendered appropriate by her assumption, in 1858, of the direct

<p>Meanwhile, the Eastern Question had burst out again. Insurrections in the Turkish provinces

Mr. Gladstone threw Homer and theology to the

for popularity should study the course he steered in the
storm that was raging round him. But before it came to its
height, he had spoken his last words in the House of Commons.
On August 11, 1876, Mr. Evelyn Ashley charged the Government
with negligence and the British Ambassador at Constantinople
with mischievous and dilatory tactics, in their
dealings with the Porte and their toleration of massacres.
Disraeli replied in one of the most effective speeches he ever
delivered, concluding with the words: &ldquo;What our duty is at
this critical moment is to maintain the Empire of England.
Nor will we ever agree to any step, though it may obtain for
a moment comparative quiet and a false prosperity, that
hazards the existence of that Empire.&rdquo; Next morning the

Sir Stafford Northcote; a well-kept secret was revealed; Mr.
Disraeli, on whose health the stress of forty years of active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Parliamentary life had told with serious
effect, had accepted a peerage, and gone
to the House of Lords as Earl of
Beaconsfield. Not, however, to escape
responsibility. Throughout that autumn
and winter the Government was vehemently
denounced in the country for
their toleration of Turkish misdeeds, but
Lord Beaconsfield remained firm in his
resolution to refrain from embarrassing
the Porte or countenancing the designs
of Russia. Before Parliament met, cooler
counsels had begun to prevail, and when
the Czar declared war against the Sultan,

faded out of sight, and British sympathy
flowed out towards the weaker combatant.

<p>The resolute attitude of the Queen&rsquo;s Government found
an echo in the country, and the chorus of a popular music
hall ditty supplied a nickname, the exact equivalent of the
French term <i>chauviniste</i>. Everybody at this day understands
what is meant by the &ldquo;Jingo party&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Jingo policy,&rdquo;
though perhaps the origin of the phrase may come to be forgotten.
It is found in the lines shouted by enthusiastic
audiences in the early months of 1878:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to fight, but, by Jingo! if we do,</div>

</div></div>

<p>It was the policy of England in a nutshell, and it had its
effect abroad. The Russians had suffered heavily in the war:
they were in no spirit to renew it with a powerful, wealthy,
and fresh enemy. They agreed not to occupy Gallipoli, provided
the English fleet withdrew from the Sea of Marmora.

famous Congress, at which Great Britain was represented
by her Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary&mdash;Lord Beaconsfield and Lord Salisbury&mdash;effected a
re-arrangement of the Danubian provinces, a rectification of the frontier of Greece, the cession to
Russia of Batoum and Kars, with that part of Bessarabia which had been taken from her by the
Treaty of Paris, and the occupation by Great Britain of the island
of Cyprus, coupled with an obligation to defend Turkey in the
possession of her Asiatic dominions. If it was not a settlement
containing the elements of durability, nor conveying much direct
advantage to Great Britain, at least it prohibited that which Great
Britain was determined not to allow&mdash;the handing over to Russia
of the key of the Mediterranean, the highway to India&mdash;and
Beaconsfield was entitled to claim, as he did on his return before
a rapturous crowd in Downing Street, that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Plenipotentiaries
had succeeded in securing &ldquo;Peace with Honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry Irving was born at Keinton, near Glastonbury,
in 1838. He made his first appearance
on the stage at Sunderland in 1856. His connection
with the Lyceum dates from 1866, and his management
of that theatre from December 1878. He
was knighted in 1895.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But terrible news arrived before the close of the year. History&mdash;the
disastrous history of 1841&mdash;repeated itself with extraordinary
exactness. Sir Louis Cavagnari had been sent as envoy to Cabul
early in 1878 to watch and, if possible, counteract the effect of the
persistent advance of Russia towards the frontier of British India.
He was lodged with a small escort, in comfortable, but defenceless,
quarters in the Bala Hissar or citadel of Cabul. The Amir Yakoob
soon began to show impatience at the presence of the British in
his capital. He was in difficulties also with his own troops, who
were clamorous for arrears of pay. On September 3 a riotous
mob collected in front of the British Embassy; blows were struck
and shots fired, and soon Cavagnari and his household were closely
besieged. He had with him a secretary, a surgeon, and Lieutenant
Hamilton, commanding the escort of twenty-six troopers and fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
men of the corps of Guides. These made a brave defence, but at last the buildings were set on
fire, and the envoy and every soul with
him perished in the flames.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Massacre at Cabul.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Amir represented to the Viceroy that this was
the result of a mutiny against his own
authority, and this seems to have been
the case; he was powerless to prevent
what perhaps he did not greatly deplore.
Not the less necessary was it to exact
punishment for the massacre. General
Stewart, who had just evacuated Candahar
under provisions of the recent treaty,
re-occupied it; General Baker advanced
by the Shutar Gardan and seized Kushi.
On October 6 General Roberts (now
Lord Roberts), acting in concert with
General Baker, defeated a large force of Ghilzais, with artillery, on the heights of Chardeh, and then
fought his way to Cabul, which he entered on the 12th.</p>

</div>

<p>All this time Yakoob Khan had been making
friendly professions, and remained with the British field
force during its operations. But there was reason to
suspect his complicity in the massacre; he tendered
his abdication to General Roberts, and was sent as a
State prisoner to India. Then followed painful scenes
in Cabul, the assassins of Cavagnari&rsquo;s party being
hunted out and many of them publicly hanged. The
townspeople remained sullen: the Afghan warriors left
Cabul and collected at Ghazni, where an aged Mollah
was preaching a holy war. By the beginning of December
the whole country was
under arms, burning to reenact
the scenes of 1842.
But they had a different
man from General Elphinstone
to deal with in
General Roberts. He continued
to receive reinforcements
from India,
and made such good use
of them that, after much
hard fighting, the insurgent
tribes under Mohamed Jan
were completely dispersed.</p>

<p>But there were many
claimants to the throne of
the Amir. Among these
was Abdurrahman, who
lived in Turkestan, subsidised
and protected by
Russia. This prince appeared in Northern Afghanistan in March 1880, and a formidable rising took
place in support of his claim. On April 19 General Stewart encountered a force, about 15,000 strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
at Ahmed Kel, and a fierce encounter took place. For some time it seemed as if the furious onslaught
of the Afghans must prevail; the British infantry were driven back; it was only by means of his
artillery that Stewart saved the day and the enemy was routed in the end.</p>

<p>In this position affairs in Afghanistan must be left, in order to trace the momentous course
of events at home, which wrought a remarkable change on the character and object of the war.
But before reverting to
the fortunes of the
Beaconsfield Ministry,
it is necessary to make
mention of another and
more lamentable war
which took place in
another quarter of the
globe simultaneously
with the Afghan Campaign.
The River
Tugela formed the
boundary between the
British Colony of Natal
and the territory of the Zulus, the
most powerful nationality in South
Africa. Land disputes between the
Zulus and the Dutch Boers of the
Transvaal Republic had been brewing
for many years, and at last hostilities
broke out between them.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Zulu War.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Boers were badly beaten by a young Zulu
chief called Sikukuni, and both sides
appealed to the British Government to
intervene. Sir Theophilus Shepstone was sent into the Transvaal to adjudicate between them, and sought
to solve the problem by annexing the whole territory, not without the consent of the Republican leaders,
the disputed land being handed over to the Zulus. This settlement might have proved effective but
for the outrageous behaviour of Cetchwayo, King of the Zulus, who suddenly developed a most violent
temper, probably arising from a growing taste for British rum. Even then, had matters been left in
the hands of Sir Henry Bulwer, the Governor of Natal, matters might have been maintained on a
friendly footing. Unfortunately, Sir Bartle Frere, the Queen&rsquo;s High Commissioner in South Africa,
saw grounds for apprehension in the immense force maintained by Cetchwayo on the frontier, and
began moving troops from Cape Colony into Natal. He endeavoured to exact guarantees from the
Zulu king of an extremely onerous nature, fixing January 11, 1879, as the limit for their acceptance.
Sir Bartle Frere&rsquo;s action can only be justified by the supposition that war was, sooner or later,
inevitable, a belief which neither Sir Henry Bulwer nor the Colonial Office entertained. Cetchwayo
allowed the prescribed day to pass without complying with the High Commissioner&rsquo;s demands. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the very next day British troops under Lord Chelmsford invaded Zululand, the force advancing in
three columns, under Colonel Glyn, Colonel Pearson, and Colonel Durnford. Colonel Durnford&rsquo;s
column occupied a camp at Isandhlana on January 21; and the following day, being attacked by
about 20,000 Zulus, were almost annihilated.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Disaster of Isandhlana.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The 1st Battalion of the 24th Foot
was destroyed, thirty officers and 500 men being slain. Colonel Durnford and
Colonel Pulleine were killed, and immense quantities of stores fell into the hands of the enemy. It
was a terrible retribution for having underrated the resources and numbers of the enemy and for
imperfectly reconnoitring his position. A similar disaster very nearly befell Colonel Pearson&rsquo;s column.
On the day after the tragedy at Isandhlana he was beleaguered at the mission station of Ekowe.
For more than two months his little garrison of 1,200 held out against incessant assaults by immense
numbers of Zulus, till, in the last days of March, provisions had run dangerously low. On April 1
Lord Chelmsford, having received reinforcements from England, advanced with 4,000 British troops
and 2,000 friendly natives, defeated the besiegers, and raised the siege.</p>

<p>The invasion of Zululand had now assumed the proportions of a great campaign. About 20,000
British and 4,500 Colonial troops were in the field. The Government, dissatisfied with Lord Chelmsford&rsquo;s
initial want of success and subsequent hesitation, sent out Sir Garnet Wolseley to supersede
him. But before he arrived a decisive victory had been fought on July 4, whereby the power of the
Zulus was hopelessly broken. Lord Chelmsford&rsquo;s reputation, endangered at Isandhlana, was redeemed
at Ulundi, just as Lord Gough&rsquo;s disaster at Chilianwalla had been repaired at Goojerat before Sir
Charles Napier came to supersede him.</p>

<p>The native chiefs now crowded in to make submission. Cetchwayo was a fugitive with a handful
of followers, and a force of cavalry scoured the country in pursuit of him, till, on August 28, the
war was brought to an end by the capture of the unhappy king by Lord Gifford&rsquo;s party. It had cost
Great Britain dearly in lives and money; one of the most tragic incidents in it was the death of
Prince Napoleon, eldest son of the late Emperor of the French, who served on Lord Chelmsford&rsquo;s
staff as a volunteer. He was slain on June 2, when employed on surveying duty, having ridden into
an ambush of Zulus.</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="dropleft">T</span>HE position and condition of Egypt had grown to be a matter of anxiety to the Powers
of Western Europe, owing to events which it is only possible to recapitulate here in the briefest terms.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Condition of Egypt.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Ruled by the Khedive as an autonomous
State, Egypt was also technically a province of the Ottoman
Empire and paid an annual tribute of £695,792 to the Sultan of Turkey. But the
creation of the Suez Canal, the investment of European capital therein, and the importance to
maritime nations of that highway, rendered the good government of Egypt a subject of international
concern. The Khedive, Ismail Pasha, actuated, no doubt, in part, by a resolve to develop the resources
of his country, but also by aims of personal indulgence and aggrandisement, had launched into schemes
of such scale and cost that the Egyptian Treasury was virtually bankrupt in 1877. A Commission of
Inquiry, presided over by Mr. Goschen, resulted in the appointment of Mr. Rivers Wilson and M. de
Blignières, representing Great Britain and France respectively, as Members of the Khedive&rsquo;s Cabinet.
The plan failed to work smoothly; the Khedive became leader of the Opposition to his own Government,
and in February 1879 he was compelled to submit to conditions imposed by the Cabinets of Great
Britain and France, excluding him from Cabinet Councils, appointing his son Tewfik President of the
Council, and vesting in the English and French Ministers absolute power of veto upon all measures.
Ismail Pasha accepted these conditions, but on April 7 he suddenly dismissed the Cabinet and appointed
one entirely composed of natives of Egypt. On June 26, in consequence of representations from the
Governments of Germany, Austria, Great Britain, France, and Russia, the Sultan deposed Ismail and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
created his son Tewfik Khedive in his place. A new scheme of government was adopted, whereby
Tewfik appointed his own Cabinet, and the dual control of Great Britain and France was established
by the appointment of two Controllers, Mr. Baring
(now Lord Revelstoke) and M. de Blignières, with
full powers to regulate expenditure, with seats in the
Cabinet, not removable except by their own Governments,
and with power to appoint and dismiss all subordinate
officials. By the close of 1879 the credit
of Egypt, which had been apparently hopelessly
shattered by Ismail&rsquo;s decree in May 1876, suspending
payment and unifying the general debt, was restored
by the liquidation of all debts due by the State.</p>

<p>This, then, was the state of affairs in Egypt
towards the close of Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s last Administration.
The country had been redeemed from
insolvency by the joint action of Great Britain and
France, the arbitrary action of her rulers had been
put under control, and her internal affairs had been
started on such a footing as should protect the people from oppression and grievous taxation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the course of domestic politics in Great Britain claimed the immediate attention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
statesmen. On November 24, 1879, Mr. Gladstone, once more the actual, though not the nominal, leader
of the Opposition, started from Liverpool on a memorable tour. The Earl of Dalkeith was then member
for Midlothian. He was the eldest son of the Duke of Buccleuch, at that time the most notable
Scottish peer, of immense influence
north of the Tweed and leader of
the Conservative Party in the North.
Mr. Gladstone had conceived the
chivalrous idea of doing battle with
this doughty chief on his own ground.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The First Midlothian Campaign.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The first &ldquo;Midlothian Campaign&rdquo;
lasted till December
5, and it took the country by
storm. The failure of the City of
Glasgow Bank in the previous year
had not only brought disaster to
thousands of persons in the North,
but it had emphasised in a peculiar
manner the end of a period of prosperity.
Agriculture, especially, began
to feel the full effects of foreign competition;
farmers, whose rents had
been gradually increasing as the value
of land rose with favourable markets,
now found it impossible to meet their
obligations out of income. There was
the usual tendency to lay the blame of individual misfortune on the Government, and Mr. Gladstone,
though his attacks on the policy of the Cabinet were based principally on their foreign policy, which
he denounced as aggressive, evoked an immense amount of sympathy and encouragement from those
who listened to him or read his speeches.</p>

Ministers had still a year more to exist before an appeal to the country should be necessary, and
all was going quietly in Parliament, when, on March 8, people were taken by surprise on hearing it
announced that the dissolution was to take place at once, and a manifesto from
the Prime Minister, in the form
of a letter to the Duke of Marlborough,
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
was published in the newspapers, setting
forth the imminence of trouble
from Irish sedition, and calling on
the nation to be on its guard.</p>

<p>After the Fenian movement, partly owing to vigorous measures on the part of the Executive and
partly to dissension among its own leaders, had collapsed, Irish disaffection to British rule took the
form of a constitutional agitation for the establishment of a separate Legislature for Ireland. &ldquo;Home
Rule for Ireland&rdquo; became the watchword and goal of a determined group of members of Parliament,
acting under Mr. Isaac Butt, an able and successful lawyer and powerful speaker, who began political
life as a Conservative. This third party acted together throughout the Parliament of 1874&ndash;80. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
practically the creation of Mr. Butt, but it soon carried its aims far beyond what he considered
legitimate, and adopted methods of obstructing Parliamentary business, against which he protested in vain.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Irish Home Rule.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
A stronger man than Butt came to the front in the person of a Protestant Irish landlord,
Charles Stuart Parnell, one of the most remarkable figures in recent political life.
Though not gifted with the native richness of rhetoric which distinguishes so many
of his countrymen, Parnell quickly acquired an ascendancy in the Home Rule party in virtue of his
genius for strategy, his resolute will, and a kind of hauteur which lifted him above petty jealousy
and interference. From the first he discerned that the true way to attain Home Rule, if it might be
attained at all, was to maintain scrupulous independence of both Conservatives and Liberals, to raise
every possible obstruction in the way of legislation, and, in short, to render the Irish party so intolerable
to all Governments, that Home Rule should be granted as the only means of getting out of an
impossible situation. In 1878 a debate took place on the circumstances of the murder of the Earl of
Leitrim, and Butt was obliged to dissociate himself from all sympathy with the sentiments expressed by
some of his colleagues, and he resigned the leadership in favour of Parnell. After the General Election
the Home Rulers in Parliament numbered sixty, perfect in discipline and devotion to their new chief.</p>

<p>Frederick Sleigh Roberts is the son of the late General Sir A.
Roberts. Born in 1832, and educated at Eton, Sandhurst, and
Woolwich. Gained the V.C. for rescuing a standard at Khodagunj,
in the Indian Mutiny.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The pacification of Afghanistan by General Roberts was not of long duration. After those concerned
in the massacre of Cavagnari&rsquo;s party had been punished with exemplary, if not excessive,
severity, attempts were made to conciliate the people, and the Conservative Government offered to
recognise any Amir at Cabul who might be elected, except Yakub Khan. Candahar was to be separated
from Cabul, becoming an independent State under British protection, with Shir Ali as Amir. Then
came the change of Government in England, bringing about an important modification in British
policy towards Afghanistan. It was resolved to evacuate both Cabul and Candahar, resigning the
country to the claimant Abdurrahman.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>War with Afghanistan.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The advance, however, of a rival claimant from Herat, in the
person of Ayub Khan, caused the Government of India to direct General Burrows
to defend the passage of the River Helmund. Beyond that river lay the territory
of the Wali of Zamindawir, an ally of the British in resisting Ayub Khan&rsquo;s invasion. But the
Wali&rsquo;s army mutinied and deserted to Ayub, and General Burrows decided to retire to Kushk-i-Nakhud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
thirty miles in rear of the Helmund. Ayub then crossed the river, and directed his march
to Maiwand, a Pass over the hills twelve miles north of Burrows&rsquo;s camp. General Burrows, in total
ignorance of the real strength of the enemy, resolved to
march there and clear the Pass. On July 27 he started
with a force of 2,500 men, six nine-pounders, and some
smooth-bores. Unfortunately, instead of keeping to his
purpose of occupying Maiwand, which lay on his right,
General Burrows made the fatal mistake of attacking a
column of the enemy which appeared on his left. He
found himself engaged with Ayub&rsquo;s whole army, variously
estimated at from 12,000 to 20,000 of all arms. The
British troops fought gallantly, but some blunders, of a
nature never clearly explained, made their position untenable.
The order was given to retreat, not before some
of the Indian troops had broken and fled. Next day the
broken remnants of General Burrows&rsquo;s Brigade struggled
into Candahar, having fought their way through hordes
of armed villagers along the route, who rose in excitement
at the news of the defeat of the British. All that mortal
man could do to atone for his want of generalship was
done by General Burrows, who fought with desperate
gallantry at Maiwand; but half his Brigade perished, and
probably it would have been annihilated but for the
steadiness of the Horse Artillery in action and in covering
the retreat.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">THE VICTORY OF CANDAHAR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The trouble which broke out in the British Dominion of South Africa in 1880 must be regarded
as the direct effect of the system of British party politics. Forasmuch as, taking their cue from
Mr. Gladstone, the Opposition had vehemently denounced the annexation of the Transvaal, on the overthrow
of the Conservatives the &ldquo;patriot&rdquo; section of the Boers not unnaturally expected the restoration
of their independence. But these hopes were dispelled by Mr. Gladstone and Lord Kimberley, the
Colonial Secretary, in the debate on the Queen&rsquo;s speech to the new Parliament. They declared that
Great Britain was under pledges to the native population which made it impossible for her to recede.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Revolt of the Transvaal.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The effect of this was to exasperate the Boers to the last degree. They rose in
armed revolt, and proclaimed an independent Republic on December 16, 1880.
Detachments of British troops were beleaguered by the insurgents at several places,
and a detachment of the 94th Regiment, under Colonel Anstruther, marching to the relief of Pretoria,
suffered defeat, all of them being slain or captured. The whole Dutch population of the Transvaal
were under arms by the beginning of 1881, and their skill as riflemen rendered them a foe far more
formidable than might have been expected from their numbers.</p>

<p>It is a painful duty to record faithfully the events of the succeeding weeks. On January 24,
Sir George Colley, Governor of Natal, entered the Transvaal with 1,000 troops, attacking the Boers
at Laing&rsquo;s Nek on the 28th, when he was repulsed with the loss of seven officers and eighty men
killed and 100 wounded. On February 7 Colley was attacked on the Ingogo River, and, though
the enemy retired at sunset, the British loss amounted to six officers and sixty-two men killed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
sixty-four wounded. On February 26 General Colley returned to the attack on the Boers&rsquo; camp at
Laing&rsquo;s Nek. He decided on occupying Majuba Hill, overlooking the enemy&rsquo;s position; and, owing to
the great fatigue endured during the ascent, in which his men were occupied for eight hours of darkness,
he neglected to intrench the ground. The position was naturally an exceedingly strong one, yet on the
following morning, the 27th, it was stormed by the Boers. The British force, 627 strong, was routed,
with very heavy loss, and Sir George Colley was among the slain.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Establishment of the Boer Republic.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Sir Evelyn Wood, who had arrived in the neighbourhood with reinforcements, now succeeded
to the chief command, and entered into negotiations with the Boer commander,
Joubert. These resulted in the conclusion of peace on March 21, the terms including recognition of the
Queen&rsquo;s suzerainty over the Transvaal, but securing complete self-government to the Boer Republic.</p>

<p>An eye-witness of the attack on Laing&rsquo;s Nek thus describes the incident depicted: &ldquo;Poor Elwes fell among
the 58th. He shouted to another Eton boy (adjutant of the 58th, whose horse had been shot): &lsquo;Come
along, Monck! Floreat Etona! we must be in the front rank,&rsquo; and he was shot immediately.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The task of the Government within the walls of the House of Commons was rendered an easy
one during 1880 and 1881, by reason of the spiritless and disorganised condition of the Opposition
under the mild and forbearing
generalship of Sir Stafford Northcote.
The Conservatives, moreover,
found themselves under the
obligation of voting continually in
the same lobby as their natural
opponents, in resistance to the
demands of the Parnellite Party
and in support of measures for
the protection of life and property
in Ireland. Little resistance, indeed,
would have been encountered
by Ministers, but for the spirited
action of a small knot of members
below the Gangway. This group,
led by Lord Randolph Churchill,
and comprising Mr. Arthur Balfour,
Sir John Gorst, and Sir
Henry Drummond Wolff, allowed
no subject to be dealt with without
the closest and most persistent scrutiny.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Fourth Party.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Their diligence, their
individual and varied ability, and
their permanent presence
on the same bench, soon caused
them to be known as the Fourth
Party; and the intrepidity of their
attacks on the Government was not more remarkable than the freedom with which they taunted the
Tory leaders for their inaction, especially Northcote, Cross, and Smith.</p>

<p>More and more did the Irish Question absorb the attention of Parliament and the public.
Parnell was busy at the work of land agitation, and explained the means by which landlords were
to be driven from Ireland. Speaking at Ennis, he exclaimed, &ldquo;What is to be done with a tenant
bidding for a farm from which another tenant has been evicted?&rdquo; &ldquo;Shoot him!&rdquo; cried a voice in the
crowd. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Parnell, &ldquo;I do not say shoot him; there is a more Christian and charitable way
of dealing with him. Let him be shunned in the street, in the shop, in the market-place&mdash;even in the
places of worship&mdash;as if he were a leper of old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the earliest cases in which this advice was carried into effect was that of Captain Boycott,
the Earl of Erne&rsquo;s agent. The Land League issued orders that he was to be treated &ldquo;as a leper of
old&rdquo;; his men deserted him on the eve of harvest; tradesmen refused to supply goods; not a soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
in the district dared to be known to have intercourse with him.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Boycotting.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Captain Boycott was a man of
spirit: he brought a hundred Ulstermen to gather the crops on his large farm; the
Irish Government massed 7,000 troops and police to protect them, and henceforth
the verb &ldquo;to boycott&rdquo; became the recognised expression for a
system which brought infinite suffering on many poor people.</p>

<p>But a terrible era of violence and crime, inaugurated by the
murder of Viscount Mountmorres on September 25, 1880, proved
that the old methods of terrorising were far from obsolete, and
that the &ldquo;more Christian and charitable&rdquo; boycotting was only a
supplement to them. The transparency of the veil thrown over
the connection of the Land League with atrocious crimes made it
necessary to strengthen the hands of the Executive by the introduction
of a fresh Coercion Bill, with clauses specially framed to
deal with the new system of intimidation known as boycotting.
Mr. Forster, by a merciful instruction to substitute buckshot for

Assent, on March 21, than Mr. Gladstone
announced another great measure dealing with
Ireland, framed to conciliate disaffection and redress the complaints of Irish farmers.

<p>The statue erected to the memory of the Earl of
Beaconsfield in Parliament Square is annually decorated,
on &ldquo;Primrose Day&rdquo; (April 19) with palms and flowers, and
vendors of primroses drive a busy trade in &ldquo;button-holes&rdquo;
amongst the onlookers. A similar tribute is annually paid
to the memory of General Gordon, whose statue stands in
the centre of Trafalgar Square; and for the last two years
the Nelson Column itself has, on &ldquo;Trafalgar Day,&rdquo; been
hung with festoons of evergreens.</p>

<p>For some time previous to this, affairs in Egypt had not
been running smoothly under the dual control. A military
party had been formed, under the lead of Ahmed Arabi Bey,
calling itself national, but really military, aiming at the effacement
of the Khedive and the fulfilment of the shadowy purpose
of &ldquo;Egypt for the Egyptians.&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Military Revolt in Egypt.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Various disturbances
took place in Alexandria during
1881, but in May 1882 matters wore such
a threatening aspect that the allied English and French fleets
were sent to anchor off that city. The Khedive, in his extremity,
had promoted Arabi to be War Minister, who used
his power to put the fortifications of Alexandria in a thorough
state of defence and began massing troops in the town. On
July 7 Admiral Sir Beauchamp Seymour, commanding the
British fleet, warned Arabi that unless these warlike preparations
were discontinued, he should be obliged to open fire. No
notice being taken of this, ships were provided for the safety of
European inhabitants, and on the 10th the British ultimatum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
was sent, demanding the instant cessation of the works of defence and their surrender to the
British flag. Arabi having failed to comply with this also, the British ships, consisting of eight
powerful ironclads and five gun-vessels, cleared for action and took up their positions, the French fleet
retiring to Port Said. The bombardment began on the morning of
July 11, briskly replied to by the guns in the forts, and continued
all day till 5.30 p.m. Resumed next day, it was continued at
intervals till the afternoon, when it was found that, under cover
of a flag of truce, Arabi had withdrawn his troops and abandoned
the forts and town. A frightful scene began directly military
authority was withdrawn: the populace broke loose, pillaging and
firing the shops and houses, and massacring about 2,000 Europeans
who had not availed themselves of the opportunity to escape.
Arabi, the Khedive&rsquo;s War Minister, was at the head of the Khedive&rsquo;s
army, yet Great Britain assumed the task of dispersing this army
in order to re-conquer the country for the Khedive.</p>

<p>To the unofficial mind the reasons for the destruction of
Alexandria and the invasion of Egypt remain somewhat vague;
Mr. Gladstone, however, found little difficulty in persuading the
House of Commons to entrust him with a Vote of Credit for
£2,300,000; and towards the end of August an army, consisting
of about 23,000 of all arms and ranks, landed on the Mediterranean
shores of Egypt; subsequently reinforced by 11,000 more. In
addition to these, there was an Indian contingent landed from
the South, consisting of nearly 8,000 men, making the total strength of the British land forces in Egypt
40,560 men, under the command-in-chief of Sir Garnet Wolseley. It was found on landing, on
August 22, that the enemy had placed dams across the Canal to cut off the water supply, and it
became necessary to dislodge him from his position at Tel-el-Mahuta. This was effected without
much difficulty on August 24, the Egyptian troops, about 10,000 strong, showing little inclination for fighting.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Battles of Kassassin and Tel-el-Kebir.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
General Graham then advanced, on the 26th, with 2,000 men, to seize
Kassassin Lock, which controlled the supply of fresh water. Here he was attacked,
on the 28th, by a greatly superior force, and for a time the British were in a
critical position. General Graham, however, managed to hold his own, and heliographed for reinforcements,
which arrived in good time. The Egyptians fought well during the afternoon, but at sunset
Sir Baker Russell led up the
Household Cavalry, the 7th Dragoon
Guards, and Horse Artillery,
with four guns, and a brilliant
charge of these fine troops threw
the enemy into confusion, causing
him to break and fly from the
field. The total British loss was
only eleven killed and sixty-eight
wounded.</p>

<p>Son of Major Garnet Wolseley. Born
near Dublin in 1833. Commanded the
Red River Expedition of 1870 and the
Ashanti Expedition of 1873, and was
sent out in 1879 as Governor of Natal
and the Transvaal, and High Commissioner.
He commanded the forces in

<p>Arabi held a strongly-fortified
position at Tel-el-Kebir. On September
9 he attempted a reconnaissance,
with 8,000 men and
twenty-four guns, but was driven
back with the loss of some of
his guns. Tel-el-Kebir offered a
front to the British advance of
about four miles of earthworks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
with redoubts at intervals carrying guns. The flanks were protected by similar works. Wolseley
struck his camp on the evening of September 12, and advanced during the night with 2,000 cavalry,
11,000 infantry, and sixty guns. At dawn on the 13th General Graham&rsquo;s
Brigade on the right, and Sir Archibald Alison&rsquo;s Highland Brigade
on the left, were within a quarter of a mile of the Egyptian lines.
An irregular fire was opened upon them; they dashed forward to the
assault, scaled the outer defences, bayonetted the gunners, paused to
re-form, and advanced against the inner and stronger works. It remains
a question of honourable rivalry which were first inside the Egyptian
position, the Highlanders on the left or Graham&rsquo;s infantry on the right.
At all events, within half an hour the whole of Arabi&rsquo;s defences were
captured, his army was routed and flying under pressure of the British
cavalry. The British loss in this well-managed affair was very slight,
considering the strength of the position and the strength of Arabi&rsquo;s army,
supposed to amount to about 25,000 men. Eleven officers and forty-three
men were killed, and twenty-two officers and 320 men wounded. The
Egyptian loss was believed to be about 1,000; of prisoners, 3,000 were
taken, with sixty guns. The campaign was practically over. Arabi&rsquo;s
troops disbanded themselves, and Arabi himself was arrested in Cairo.
Being brought to trial as a rebel, he pleaded guilty, and sentence of
death was passed on him. This sentence was commuted immediately
by the Khedive for one of perpetual banishment from Egypt.</p>

<p>The net result of these events was the withdrawal of the <i>condominium</i>
or dual control by England and France, the restoration of the Khedive&rsquo;s authority, and the reconstruction
of the administrative and social system. But the British continued to occupy Egypt as
security for the pacific fulfilment of the reforms insisted on by the English Plenipotentiary, Lord Dufferin.</p>

<p>There was great jubilation over this among the Nationalists. It
was a distinct surrender on the part of the Government to the party
of separation: and the suppressed Land League was revived openly
under the name of the National League. The response to the new
policy of conciliation and condonement came in terrible fashion. Earl
Cowper and Mr. Forster had been succeeded in the Lord Lieutenancy
and Chief Secretaryship by Earl Spencer and Lord Frederick Cavendish.
On May 6 the last-named gentleman, a brother of the present Duke of
Devonshire, after attending the installation of his chief, took a car to
drive out to the Chief Secretary&rsquo;s Lodge. Overtaking Mr. Burke, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>

It was a fine spring evening, between seven and eight o&rsquo;clock; just as they were
passing an opening in the trees on their right, giving a view of the Viceregal Lodge,
two men came along the path to meet them. One of them, Brady, a man of
immense size and strength, stooped down as if to tie his shoe-lace. As the two
gentlemen passed him, he sprang erect, gripped Mr. Burke by the waist, and stabbed
him in the back. The other ruffian, Kelly, slashed Burke across the throat as he fell. Lord Frederick,
attempting to defend his friend with an umbrella, received a fatal thrust in the breast from Brady&rsquo;s
knife, and fell dead also.</p>

<p>On the 8th of the following month a gentleman called Walter Bourke, riding with a soldier as
escort near Gort, was shot at, and both were killed; and in like manner, on the 29th, Mr. Blake, a
land agent, and his steward, Mr. Keene, were murdered by concealed assassins near Lough Rea.
Ireland had come to a desperate condition; it was garrisoned with not less than 20,000 cavalry and
infantry and 20,000 mounted constabulary, yet the Executive seemed powerless to cope with an
almost universal conspiracy against life and property. The murdered Cavendish was succeeded as
Chief Secretary by Mr. G. O. Trevelyan, and the first act of the Government was to introduce a fresh
Coercion Bill, of extraordinary severity, creating special tribunals for the trial of suspects and criminals,
conferring rights of search on the police, and giving further powers for dealing with incitement to
crime. The Bill was vehemently opposed by Mr. Parnell and his party; nevertheless, the Government
pursued their apparently hopeless policy of conciliation by introducing and carrying through the
Arrears of Rent Bill, whereby about two millions of money was applied to release Irish tenants of a
moiety of the liabilities which the Land League had forbidden them to fulfil, and the balance of
arrears was wiped out at the expense of landlords.</p>

<p>The additional powers conferred on the police by the Crimes Act of 1882 resulted in the capture
of the gang who had planned and carried out the murders in the Ph&oelig;nix Park. In January 1883
seventeen persons were arrested in Dublin, and on one of them, Farrell, turning informer, it came out
that they were members of a secret society. Their principal object had been to make away with
Mr. W. E. Forster when he was Chief Secretary, and on various occasions he had escaped assassination
by what seemed the narrowest chances.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Trial and Execution of the Ph&oelig;nix Park Murderers.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Among those arrested was James Carey, who had given the
signal for the murder of Burke by raising a white handkerchief, and who turned
Queen&rsquo;s evidence. He was allowed to go free after the trial, while five of his gang
were hanged, the remainder being sentenced to various terms of penal servitude.
Finally, this bloody chapter was brought to a close in the murder of Carey himself,
by a man named O&rsquo;Donnell, who had travelled in the same ship with him to Cape Town. O&rsquo;Donnell
was brought home to England and hanged early in December.</p>

<p>While the trial of the Ph&oelig;nix Park assassins was proceeding, another formidable conspiracy was
brought to light. A gang of Irish-Americans had come to this country with the object of terrorising
the Government by a series of explosions of nitro-glycerine.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Dynamite Conspiracy.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
On the evening of March 15, 1883, part of the Local Government Board Offices in Whitehall was
wrecked by the explosion of a canister of dynamite placed inside one of the
balustrades. Simultaneously, another explosion took place at the office of the <i>Times</i>, in Printing
House Square. By the help of informers, the police were enabled to arrest a number of persons
in London, Birmingham, and Glasgow, all of whom were brought to trial, and most of them proved
to be active agents in a heinous conspiracy against life and property. The formidable power which
modern explosives had brought within the reach of secret societies made it necessary to make the law
dealing with such crimes more stringent, and Sir William Harcourt, the Home Secretary, on April 9,
introduced a Bill to cope with what he termed &ldquo;the pirates of the human race.&rdquo; He assured the House
that the danger was so grave and imminent that the Bill must pass through all its stages on that day. It
was read a first, a second time, passed through Committee, and was read a third time, all within little more
than an hour. Taken up to the Lords on the same evening, it was dispatched there with equal promptitude,
and received the Royal Assent next day&mdash;an example of rapid legislation almost without parallel.</p>

<p>A much-needed boon was conferred this year (1883) upon Parliamentary candidates in the passage
of the Corrupt Practices at Elections Bill.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Corrupt Practices Act.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>

they had assumed in regard to Egyptian affairs.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Affairs of Egypt.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Ma&shy;hom&shy;ed&shy;an Arabs of the Soudan had been
brought under Egyptian rule in 1870; gross misgovernment had brought about
bitter disaffection, and the troubles of Lower Egypt before and during Arabi&rsquo;s
revolt, afforded these wild tribes an opportunity for throwing off the yoke. Mohamed Ahmed appeared
among them as the Mahdi, or Redeemer, who, besides being a religious enthusiast, was a daring and
skilful commander in the field. In 1883 the Egyptian Government sent an army of about 11,000 men
under command of Colonel Hicks, a retired officer of the Indian army, to restore the Khedive&rsquo;s
authority in the Equatorial
Provinces. This force was
attacked on November 1 in a
rocky defile; for three days
they defended themselves; on
the fourth their ammunition
was all spent, and every man
in the Egyptian army, with
many British officers, perished.
Of course, this tremendous
victory was accepted by the
Arabs as complete proof of
the Mahdi&rsquo;s divine mission:
the insurrection spread like
wildfire, and the Khedive, acting
under advice of the British
Government, decided not to
attempt the re-conquest of
these provinces.</p>

<p>These shears, photographed at the works of the Glasgow Iron and Steel Company,
are capable of cutting through solid steel slabs 4 feet wide and 12 inches
thick. The slabs travel over the &ldquo;live rollers&rdquo; in the floor to and from the
shears. The use of steel in large quantities, both for shipbuilding and for the
making of rails, was rendered possible by the introduction of the &ldquo;Bessemer
Process&rdquo; (named after its inventor, Sir Henry Bessemer) in 1860. Steel which
had hitherto cost £50 or £60 a ton, now cost but £7 or £8, and rapidly superseded
iron. The Bessemer &ldquo;Converter&rdquo; has, however, itself given place to the
Siemens open-hearth furnace.</p>

<p>But the relief of Sinkat,
Tokar, Khartoum, and other
stations, garrisoned by Egyptian
troops under command of
European officers, was imperative. Expeditions to the relief of the two places first named were attacked
by the Arabs and cut to pieces, and instructions were telegraphed for the immediate evacuation of
Khartoum. But in Khartoum there were not less than 11,000 persons, many of them Christians and
many in the Egyptian civil service, and to transport these safely down the Nile would be an operation
of exceeding difficulty and hazard.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>General Gordon sent to Khartoum.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
General Gordon, commonly called &ldquo;Chinese
Gordon,&rdquo; a man of remarkable character, happened to be in London at the time,
preparing to start for the Congo in the service of the King of the Belgians. He
had been Governor of the Soudan in 1874, under Ismail, and to him the British Government appealed
in their perplexity. He readily consented to throw up his engagement under the King of the Belgians,
and to proceed to Khartoum, telegraphing to the garrison of that place: &ldquo;You are men, not women.
Be not afraid. I am coming.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the Mahdi had scored another signal success. Baker Pasha,
formerly a well-known officer in the English cavalry, advanced in January, with a force of 3,500, to
the relief of Tokar and Sinkat; he was attacked near Trinkitat and overwhelmed; his half-trained
Egyptians fled, and were cut down to the number of 2,200, and sixteen European officers perished.
Then Sinkat fell, the throats of all the garrison being cut, and Tokar surrendered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
The safety of Lower Egypt being threatened by the Mahdi&rsquo;s continued success, the British Government
undertook the defence of a frontier line drawn through Souakim. General Graham ascended the
Nile with about 4,000 troops, and inflicted a
severe defeat on the Arabs, under Osman Digna,
at El Teb, on February 29. Again, on March 11,
Graham attacked Osman Digna&rsquo;s camp at Tamai,
captured, and gave it to the flames.</p>

18. Finding that things were even worse
than he expected, he decided to avail himself of
the services of Zebehr Pasha, and telegraphed to
Cairo for the Government to allow him to come.
Sir Evelyn Baring strongly advised that consent
should be given, but Zebehr was of evil repute
as a slave-driving chief; stringent instructions
were sent from London that he was on no account
to be employed, and that if he attempted to join
Gordon he was to be detained by force. The
Mahdi&rsquo;s forces invested Khartoum on March 23.
Gordon, who had to contend with treachery inside
the walls, as well as the open enemy outside,
displayed extraordinary energy and ingenuity in defence, continuing to send urgent appeals for assistance,
both for Khartoum and for Berber, which was also beleaguered. Berber fell before the end of
May; still the British Government turned a deaf ear to Gordon&rsquo;s messages.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Gordon Besieged.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
At last the gallant
General appealed from the Government to the &ldquo;millionaires of England and America&rdquo; to send him
money enough to raise 2,000 or 3,000 Turkish troops
to save Khartoum. It is, perhaps, well that by the
beginning of May the enemy had
gathered so closely round Khartoum
that Lord Granville&rsquo;s response never reached Gordon.
It was to the effect that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government
was not prepared to supply either Turkish or any
other troops for military
expeditions, and
Gordon was reminded
that the mission
he had undertaken
was of a pacific nature!
But the spirit
of the British people
was galled by the
indifference shown
by the Government
to the fate of their
devoted servant; expressions
of indignation
grew louder and
more frequent both
in Parliament and in the press, and, at last, early in August, a vote of credit for £300,000 was
obtained for the purpose of &ldquo;preparations, as distinct from operations,&rdquo; for a possible expedition to
Khartoum. Lord Wolseley went out to view the military aspect of affairs, and before long a strong
force was ascending the Nile.</p>

1833&ndash;1885.</p>

<p>Served in the Crimean War, and in China in
1860&ndash;62. In 1862 he took command of a small and
heterogeneous force which, as &ldquo;The Ever-victorious
Army,&rdquo; suppressed the Tai-ping rebellion and saved
the Chinese empire. The story of his mission to
Khartoum in 1884 is told in these pages.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Too late! Help had been withheld too long. On the last day of the year a tiny scrap of paper
reached the British head-quarters on the Nile&mdash;&ldquo;Khartoum all right. C. G. Gordon. December 14,
1884&rdquo;; but on February 5, 1885, arrived a telegram in London
announcing that the place had fallen.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Too Late!<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
When Parliament opened, on the 19th, Mr. Gladstone
endeavoured to excuse the Government for their undoubted share
in the disaster. &ldquo;General Gordon contentedly forbore,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;indeed more than contentedly&mdash;he determinedly forebore&mdash;to make
use of the means of personal safety which were at all times open
to him.&rdquo; The words seemed to be swept from the Prime Minister&rsquo;s
lips by a hurricane of indignant exclamations, and he withdrew
them. They meant that Gordon might have escaped down the river
in a steamer, leaving the loyal Egyptians in Khartoum to their
fate. He was not that kind of man. Party discipline prevailed to
protect the Government from overthrow on a vote of censure:
they managed to put into their lobby 302 against 288.</p>

<p>Khartoum fell on January 26, 1885, after a siege of 317 days,
and after the garrison and townsfolk had endured extreme privations
for several weeks. Gordon was shot down near the palace,
and a horrible massacre followed, in which it was reckoned about
4,000 people were butchered.</p>

<p>Lord Wolseley&rsquo;s expeditionary force, amounting to about 14,000
men, inflicted several defeats on the Mahdi&rsquo;s troops, notably at
Abu Klea and Gubat. But the British losses were exceptionally
severe, not only on account of the invincible courage of the Arabs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
and their desperate mode of fighting, but because of sickness and climate.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Abandonment of the Soudan.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
For example, out of General
Stewart&rsquo;s desert force of 2,000, no less than thirty officers, including General Stewart
himself and 450 men perished. The Mahdi died of fever in July, and the Government
decided on withdrawing from the Soudan and fixing the frontier of Egypt
at the second Nile cataract.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It is necessary at this point to revert to the session of 1884. Mr. Gladstone had resolved on
a further extension of the Parliamentary electorate by carrying out the equalisation of the county
and borough franchise.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Reform Bill.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
His Bill was received by the Conservative Op&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion with
that half-hearted resistance
which comes
of inward disapproval, tempered by dread
of alienating the new electors, whom they
were not strong enough to exclude. In
the end they took their stand on the
ground that no such Reform Bill should
pass without a corollary measure redistributing
seats. It passed the Commons,
but the House of Lords declined to consider
it until they had the redistribution
scheme before them. In vain Lord
Granville pledged the Government to
introduce a Redistribution Bill the following
year, if their Lordships would allow
the Franchise Bill to pass at once.
Lord Salisbury declared that he was not
going to discuss redistribution with a
rope round his neck. At last, after much
wrangling, after the usual denunciations
of the House of Lords on public platforms,
and after sundry processions and
demonstrations in London, it was agreed
to hang up the Franchise Bill, prorogue
Parliament, and call it together in the
autumn to consider the complete scheme.
This was done accordingly; the Franchise
Bill was passed, and the Redistribution
Bill read a second time, and the
Committee stage postponed till after the
Christmas recess.</p>

<p>But before that subject could be
taken up again, the troubles of the
Government had multiplied. Not only
had Khartoum fallen, thereby rendering
the Nile expedition as fruitless as it
was costly, but the violation by the Russians of the Afghan frontier, seemed
to render war with Russia all but inevitable, if our treaty engagements were to be held sacred.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Afghan Frontier.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
&ldquo;The House will not be surprised,&rdquo; said the Prime Minister, referring to the defeat of
the Amir&rsquo;s troops by General Komaroff, &ldquo;when I say, speaking with measured words in circumstances
of great gravity, that to us ... this attack bears the appearance of an unprovoked aggression.&rdquo;
Still more profound grew the conviction that the country was on the eve of a great war when, on
April 27, Mr. Gladstone came down to the House to ask for a vote of credit for £11,000,000.
But he did not tell the House, in the course of a magnificent and most stirring speech, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Government practically had averted the danger by recalling Sir Peter Lumsden, the British Commissioner
in Afghanistan, thereby condoning the offence of the Russians which he (Mr. Gladstone) had
denounced already as &ldquo;unprovoked aggression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All Parliamentary business, it was understood, including, the redistribution of seats, was to be
speedily disposed of in order to make an early appeal to the constituencies under the new franchise.

But, in an unlucky hour for his colleagues, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Mr. Childers, decided to include in his Budget provision for increasing the duties
on beer and spirits. There is no more perfectly organised body than the
Licensed Victuallers; none whom ordinary members are more unblushingly anxious to conciliate on the
eve of a general election. Early in June the Government were beaten on Mr. Childers&rsquo; proposal by
a majority of twelve votes, and resigned.</p>

<p>The Queen accepted Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s resignation by telegram, and entrusted Lord Salisbury with

<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s First Administration.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But it was far from being so:
a determined revolt was being conducted by Lord Randolph Churchill and his
sympathisers&mdash;the &ldquo;rapier and rosette&rdquo; Tories&mdash;against Sir Stafford Northcote&rsquo;s
ineffective leadership. Amiable, cultivated, experienced, and sagacious as he was, Northcote had failed
to gain the confidence of the combative spirits in his party, who recognised their real captain in
the brilliant but erratic Churchill. Lord Salisbury solved the difficulty of uniting these discordant
elements by removing Northcote to the Lords, with the title of Earl of Iddesleigh and the office
of First Lord of the Treasury, placing Churchill in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for India,
and committing the leadership of the Commons to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach as Chancellor of the
Exchequer.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;Cabinet of Caretakers&rdquo; had but a
short existence. The new Ministry met Parliament
on July 6, and finished the necessary work
of the session in six weeks. It was understood
that Parliament was to be dissolved in time for
a general election in November. It proved a
restless autumn. In almost every constituency
canvassing and speech-making went on without
intermission for three months, Mr. Gladstone
leading the van with his third Midlothian campaign.
He gave no countenance to the demand for Irish Home Rule; on the contrary, he implored
the British electors to return such a Liberal majority as should render his party independent of the
Irish vote in Parliament. In response to this flashed out a general order from Parnell, directing
Irishmen in English and Scottish constituencies to vote solid against the Liberals, who had &ldquo;coerced
Ireland and deluged Egypt with blood.&rdquo; The Irish leader&rsquo;s policy was to keep the two great parties
balanced by the Home Rule vote, and the result of the elections was as nicely adjusted as that skilled
tactician could have desired; 335 Liberals returned to the new Parliament
were exactly balanced by 249 Conservatives and 86 Home Rulers.</p>

<p>Of course, when Parliament re-assembled in February 1886, it was
merely a question of how many weeks or days should precede the downfall
of a Ministry in such a hopeless minority in the Commons.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Third Administration.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Meanwhile strange rumours had been in circulation that Mr.
Gladstone had decided to accept the doctrine of Home
Rule for Ireland, against which he and his party had
fought hitherto with as much obstinacy as the Conservatives. On December
16 the sketch of a scheme attributed to him appeared in some of the
newspapers, and, in spite of an ambiguous disclaimer from himself, people
gradually became aware that Mr. Gladstone had resolved to extricate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
party from their subjection to the Irish party in Parliament by the astounding expedient of granting
the essence of their demands.</p>

<p class="clearleft">Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s Government fell on January 25: Mr. Gladstone became Prime Minister, and in
his Cabinet were included some of his
colleagues who had pronounced most emphatically
and most recently against Home
Rule, although the Lords Hartington, Derby,
and Selborne stood significantly aloof. The
mine was laid: the only indication of the
coming explosion was the resignation, on
March 26, by Mr. Chamberlain and Mr.
Trevelyan of their seats in the Cabinet.
The train was fired on April 8, when Mr.
Gladstone introduced his Bill for the better
government of Ireland. The permanent
furniture of the House of Commons does
not permit of more than some 400 out of
its 670 members being seated within its
walls. An attempt was made to admit the
presence of a larger number to hear the explanation of this most momentous measure; even so, only
seventy or eighty additional seats could be provided by filling the floor of the chamber with chairs.
Probably there never was such a scene of anxious expectation in the modern history of Parliament.</p>

<div class="caption"> THE FORTH BRIDGE.

<p>This bridge, rather more than a mile in length (the principal spans being 1,710 feet each),
was designed by Sir John Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker. It was commenced in 1883, and
opened by the Prince of Wales in 1890. It contains about 44,500 tons of Siemens steel, and
cost over £2,000,000.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The division on the second reading was taken on June 7, the corresponding Monday to that on
which Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s previous Administration had fallen in 1885. Ninety-three Liberals voted against
the Bill, and Ministers were left in a minority of thirty. The Liberal party was rent from summit
to base, not less completely than the Conservatives had been torn asunder by the action of their leader in 1846.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Dissolution of Parliament.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Prime Minister advised the Queen to dissolve Parliament.
Sudden and sharp was the appeal; firm and not to be misunderstood was the
response. Mr. Gladstone went out on his fourth Midlothian campaign, and
encountered no difficulty in retaining his own seat, as no opponent came forward to challenge it.
But the country turned a deaf ear to his appeal. It preferred to listen to Lord Randolph Churchill&rsquo;s
characteristic denunciation of the Home Rule Bill, than which he vowed that &ldquo;the united and
concentrated genius of Bedlam and Colney Hatch would strive in vain to produce a more striking
tissue of absurdities.&rdquo; He declared that the real reason they were asked to accept such a measure
was only, &ldquo;to gratify the ambition of an old man in a hurry.&rdquo; The result of the elections
showed 316 Conservatives, 78 Liberal Unionists, 191 official Liberals, and 85 Parnellites: or a
majority in the new House of 113 against Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Irish policy.</p>

<p>When the Queen sent for Lord
Salisbury, he invited Lord Hartington
to join him in forming a coalition Cabinet;
but the time for
that was not yet&mdash;a
purely Conservative
Ministry, therefore, was formed.

<p>By far the most striking figure in
the Conservative ranks of the House of
Commons was Lord Randolph Churchill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
He became Chancellor of the Exchequer in the new Cabinet and leader of the House of Commons.
Right well he led it through the six weeks of autumn session following on the elections. His
admirers were delighted&mdash;his critics reconciled&mdash;by
his adroit exchange of the
manners of a political bravo for those
of a responsible statesman; and that,
too, without sacrifice of power in debate
or pungency in retort. What was the
dismay of Ministerialists when, in a
moment of caprice, impatient because
he could not get exactly
his own way
on a question of
military and naval expenditure, Churchill
threw up his office and left the Cabinet!
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Lord Randolph Churchill Resigns.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This happened in December 1885; active
negotiations were going on at the time
for the redintegration of the old Liberal
Party. Mr. Chamberlain and Sir George
Trevelyan, as Unionists, had consented
to confer with Sir William Harcourt and
Mr. John Morley, as Home Rulers, at a &ldquo;round table,&rdquo; under the presidency of Lord Herschell
(also a Home Ruler).

In the opinion of most people, the return of at least half
the Liberal Unionists to their former allegiance
might be expected, as the outcome of
this conference. The stability of the Ministry, therefore, was
peculiarly jeopardised by any appearance of internal disunion at
this juncture. The crisis passed over in safety. Mr. Goschen,
an old colleague of Mr. Gladstone, having been First Lord of
the Admiralty in his first Administration, now determined to
throw in his lot with the Unionists, and accepted the office
vacated by Lord Randolph. The Round
Table Conference separated without having
found a basis of agreement, and the main
body of Liberal Unionists remained staunch
in support of Ministers.</p>

<p>The question still remained&mdash;who was
to lead the House of Commons? The
answer was a remarkable one. Mr. W. H.
Smith, in spite of the mediocrity of his
powers of oratory, had risen to very high
office in successive Conservative Cabinets.
As a man of business his reputation was
unsurpassed, and he had secured the respect
and confidence of all sections of the House
of Commons by his well-known indifference
to office and independence of its emoluments.
Upon him the choice fell; he exchanged
the post of Secretary for War for
that of First Lord of the Treasury, and
justified his appointment by leading the House of Commons with admirable temper and judgment
during five trying sessions.</p>

<p>During this year a series of events took their rise out of the publication in the <i>Times</i> of a
number of articles headed &ldquo;Parnellism and Crime,&rdquo; in which Mr. Parnell and his colleagues were
charged with active complicity in the long prevalence of outrage and terrorism in Ireland.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>&ldquo;Parnellism and Crime.&rdquo;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The <i>facsimile</i> of a letter, purporting to be
written by Parnell, was
published on April 18,
containing the following
sentence, referring to the
Ph&oelig;nix Park murders:&mdash;&ldquo;Though
I regret the
accident of Lord F.
Cavendish&rsquo;s death, I cannot
refuse to admit that
Burke got no more than
his deserts.&rdquo; This letter
was repudiated by Parnell
in his place in the House
of Commons; but the
Government resisted a motion
to the effect that the
<i>Times</i>, in publishing these
articles, had been guilty
of breach of privilege.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Mr. Gladstone then moved for a Select Committee to enquire into the truth of the charges, but
this also was refused by the Government. The request for a Select Committee was renewed in
the following year by Mr. Parnell, in order to enquire into the authenticity of certain letters produced
in an action for libel brought against the proprietors of the <i>Times</i> by Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell, one
of Mr. Parnell&rsquo;s followers.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Appointment of Special Commission of Judges.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Mr. W. H. Smith stated, in reply (July 12), that, in the opinion of the
Government, a Select Committee of the House of Commons was not a suitable tribunal to try
charges arising out of the action of political parties, but that the Government
were willing to appoint a Special Commission of Judges to enquire into the whole allegations.
Unfortunately, the debates on the Bill necessary to constitute
this Commission were excessively heated. The fact, an infelicitous one, it must be allowed, that
the Attorney-General, a member of the Government, had acted as leading counsel for the <i>Times</i>
in the late trial, gave colour to the unfounded charge that the Government had been acting all
along in collusion with the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>The Commission consisted of Sir James Hannen, Sir J. C. Day, and Sir A. L. Smith. Once
more the Attorney-General appeared as
leading counsel for the <i>Times</i>, and from
the outset the enquiry had all the appearance
of a Ministerial impeachment
of certain Irish members. The exposure
of the atrocious character of Pigott,
one of the chief witnesses relied on by
the <i>Times</i>, and his subsequent suicide,
caused that part of the charge which

</div>
</div>

<p>On the whole, the prestige of the Government
was greatly compromised by its connection with this
great trial, and the <i>Times</i> paid £5,000 solatium to
Mr. Parnell on account of the libel. Parliament
was prorogued early, on August 12, 1890, in order
to meet again before Christmas to take up the Irish
Land Bill and the Tithes Bill, which had been
sacrificed for want of time. The prospects of a
discredited Government in meeting an exhilarated
Opposition were far from auspicious, but an unexpected
event in the interval altered the whole scene.
A divorce suit was brought against Mr. Parnell by
Captain O&rsquo;Shea, formerly one of his party in Parliament,
but latterly known to have departed from
his allegiance, and the co-respondent in the suit allowed judgment to go against him without offering
any defence.</p>
</div>

<p>In no other country, perhaps, has the private misconduct of a public man such fatal effect
on his career as in Great Britain, where flagrant immorality proved against a statesman puts an
immediate end to his reputation and influence.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Fall of Parnell.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Parnell fell; Parnell, who for
sixteen years had led the Irish Party with unswerving will and undisputed
authority; Parnell, whose sagacious leadership had brought the vision of Home Rule to the very
brink of accomplishment. Mr. Gladstone wrote that, in his opinion, Mr. Parnell&rsquo;s &ldquo;continuance at
the present moment in the leadership would be productive of consequences disastrous in the highest
degree to the cause of Ireland.&rdquo; The ecclesiastical authorities in Ireland pronounced against him,
and the weight of priestly authority in the political affairs of that country can hardly be overestimated.
The Irish Party in
Parliament was divided. The majority
of forty-five, henceforth known
as Anti-Parnellites, renounced their
old chief at a stormy meeting in
Committee Room 15 of the House
of Commons; but the minority of
twenty-six remained staunch. The
crisis saved the Government.</p>

On the same day the Queen lost
one of her most devoted servants,
and the House
of Commons its
leader, in the
person of William Henry Smith,
whose health had broken down
under the strain of constant attention
to the ever-increasing work of Parliament.
Added to this anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
came the financial crisis brought about by the failure, in November 1890, of the great house of the
Barings to meet their enormous liability of £22,000,000. The stability of the whole of British finance
was threatened, but the Governors of the Bank of England came to the rescue, undertaking the
liquidation of the concern and opening a guarantee fund, which was subscribed readily, and thus
the disaster was averted.</p>

<p>The two measures by which Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s second Administration will remain distinguished
in the memory of most people were immediate and exceedingly far-reaching in their effect; that,
namely, which revolutionised the whole system of local government by the
creation of County Councils, and that which rendered elementary education free
of payment of school fees.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>County Councils.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Of the first of these measures, Mr. Ritchie, President of the Local
Government Board, was the author, and it was produced during the session of 1888. Member though
he was of a Conservative Cabinet, the most ardent Radical could not complain that Mr. Ritchie
had not dealt with ancient institutions in a sweeping manner. The levying of county rates, the
maintenance of roads and bridges, asylums, the conduct of registrations, and nearly all the duties
hitherto reposed in country gentlemen in their capacity
of members of Quarter Sessions, were transferred to
purely elective councils chosen by the ratepayers.
London, as defined by the Metropolis Management Act,
was constituted a county, and the old Metropolitan
Board of Works ceased to exist.</p>

Free education was given a place in the Government
programme of 1891, and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Mr. Goschen, was able to produce a surplus
of £2,000,000 in his Budget&mdash;just
about the sum estimated as the
cost of remitting school fees out of the public funds;
half of it was taken in order to render elementary
education free from September 1 following.</p>

<p>The mysterious epidemic which, for want of a
more precise term, is known by the Italian one of
influenza, carried off a very large number of persons

Of these the most distinguished
by position was the Duke
of Clarence, eldest son of the
Prince of Wales, and consequently ultimate heir to
the throne of Great Britain. He died on January 14,
1892, shortly before the date fixed for his marriage
with the Princess May of Teck.</p>

<p>The summer of 1892 was a period of great political agitation, in preparation for the General
Election, which was fixed to take place in July. Mr. Gladstone, notwithstanding his fourscore and
two years, set out with no manifestation of failing vigour on his fourth Midlothian campaign.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Fourth Midlothian Campaign.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The object nearest to his heart was clearly the concession of Home
Rule to Ireland; but there was put forward also on behalf of the Gladstonian
Liberal party a scheme of general social legislation, known as the Newcastle Programme, containing
a long list of measures, some of them of a very drastic nature, calculated to attract the support of
the labouring classes. The indifference felt by the bulk of English and Scottish electors to the
establishment of an Irish parliament was overborne by the hopes excited among disestablishers,
prohibitionists, eight-hours&rsquo;-day men, land-law reformers, and other enthusiasts, and their votes went
to secure the victory for the cause of Home Rule. The Unionists, who had entered office in 1886
with a majority of 116 in the House of Commons, had suffered so many losses by defection and in
by-elections that they could only reckon a majority of sixty-six when Parliament was dissolved. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
was changed by the general election, into a minority of forty, which was the exact figure by
which was carried, when Parliament re-assembled in August, a vote of no confidence in Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s
Administration, after which Mr.
Gladstone proceeded to form his
fourth and last Cabinet.</p>

Among the majority were numbered no less than
sixty-two peers whom the Queen had created on Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s own recommenda&shy;tion.
The attention
of the Ministerial
party was then directed to stirring
up popular indignation against the House
of Lords on account of their resistance
to the popular will. But it has to be
confessed that this appeal evoked remarkably
little response. On the other
hand, considerable impatience was manifested
on the part of many supporters
of the Government at the general
election, on account of the neglect to
carry out the multiform promises contained
in the Newcastle programme.
Accordingly, Parliament was summoned
together for a winter session in November
in order to consider the Parish Councils
and Employers&rsquo; Liability Bills. These
important measures, which went through
the successive stages to completion in
the course of 1894, remain the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>

<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Mr. Gladstone Resigns the Leadership.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Early in 1894 his withdrawal
from active politics was announced; the leadership of the House of Commons
devolved upon Sir William Harcourt, and, although Mr. Gladstone did not resign
his seat for Midlothian, he brought to a close a period of sixty-two years&rsquo;
attendance in the House of Commons. His last utterance from the Treasury Bench was a vehement
denunciation of the action of
the House of Lords in dealing
with the Bills last referred to.</p>

(now Lord Tweedmouth), Mr. Mundella and Sir C. Russell (Lord Russell), and Mr. Herbert Gladstone sits in the

<p>The removal of such a
puissant personality from their
head could not but have a
serious effect on the Ministerial
array, composed as it
was of such Old Liberals as
had embraced Home Rule out
of confidence in Mr. Gladstone,
New Liberals of an
extremely Democratic type
under the nominal lead of
Mr. Labouchere, the Labour
representatives, Parnellites
and Anti-Parnellites (the last-named
being further split into
sections at war among themselves).
On no single subject
were these various groups
united save in a desire to get
Home Rule out of the way.
Home Rule, indeed, had been
disposed of, but not in the only
way to satisfy its advocates.
The difficulty of the situation
was intensified by the successor
to Mr. Gladstone chosen by Her Majesty.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Lord Rosebery becomes Prime Minister.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In sending for her Foreign Minister,
the Earl of Rosebery, she was acting,
doubtless, on the advice of Mr. Gladstone
himself, but in the choice of
a peer there was abundant
cause of dissatisfaction to
most of the Ministerialists
in the House of Commons,
who had placed the &ldquo;mending
or ending&rdquo;&mdash;preferably the ending&mdash;of the House of Lords in the forefront of their programme.
Besides, it was considered by very many that Sir William Harcourt had done more to earn the
leadership of the party than Lord Rosebery, and it soon became apparent, not only that this
appointment was a cause of further disunion in the Home Rule ranks, but that Lord Rosebery
and Sir William Harcourt were far from cordial in their official relations. On June 21, 1895, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
listless debate was in progress on the Army Estimates,
the House was far less than half full, when Mr. Brodrick
moved a reduction of £100 in the salary of the Secretary
for War, Mr. Campbell-Bannerman, in order to call
attention to the alleged deficiency in the stores of small-arms
ammunition. Mr. Campbell-Bannerman offered his
personal assurance that the amount in store was adequate,
but the Opposition declined to accept it in view of the
official figures laid before the House. A division was
called; there was nothing to indicate the critical nature
of it till Mr. Ellis, the chief Ministerial Whip, to whom
the Clerk at the Table had handed the paper automatically,
passed it on to Mr. Douglas, the chief Opposition
Whip, when it was found that the Government were in
a minority of eight&mdash;132 votes to 125.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;mishap like this might have passed without immediate
effect on the fortunes of the Government, had it not been
that the form of the amendment carried was one reflecting
on the departmental administration of
one of the Secretaries of State.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s Third Administration.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Lord Rosebery tendered his resignation, and
the Queen sent for Lord Salisbury, who commenced at
once to form his third Administration. The Liberal Unionist
contingent, with the Duke of Devonshire as their chief,
elected to maintain their organisation independent of their Conservative allies; but the Ministry was
formed by a coalition of the two wings of the Unionist
party. They approached the general election in July
with such confidence of success as very rarely can be
entertained under a system of household suffrage; but
the result far exceeded their most sanguine calculations.
Sir William Harcourt lost his seat for Derby
on the first day&rsquo;s polling, the prelude of such discomfiture
as has scarcely any parallel in the history
of a political party. Reckoning the Gladstonian or
Home Rule majority in the previous Parliament at
forty-three, it was converted at the polls of 1895 into
an Unionist majority of 152. The new Ministry, in
entering office, found domestic affairs in a very tranquil
state; but troubles had been gathering for some time,
endangering the peaceful relations of Great Britain
with several foreign Powers, which called for the
exercise of all Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s experience and foresight
in undertaking once more the administration of
foreign affairs.</p>

<p>The Eastern question had passed once more into
an acute stage. The incorrigible vices of the Government

of the Christian subjects of the Sultan in Armenia.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Eastern Question.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Sympathy with the sufferers was
readily aroused in this country;
Mr. Gladstone, though no longer in Parliament, responded
to appeals made to him by various individuals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
and wrote a number of letters, in which, though at first he was careful to use no expression to
increase Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s difficulties, he gradually glided into his accustomed vehemence, and indicated
his desire that England should take vengeance on the &ldquo;Assassin of Europe,&rdquo; single-handed, if need
be. In the course of 1896 he appeared on a public platform in Liverpool, and supported this view
with great energy. This precipitated a further calamity on the
Liberal party, for, in the course of 1896, Lord Rosebery announced
that he differed so strongly from the views expressed by Mr. Gladstone,
and was, besides, so sensible of the want of cordiality in the support
given to him by some of his followers, that he felt compelled to resign
his leadership. It would be premature to attempt more than brief
allusion to events which are still in progress. The insurrection of the
Cretan subjects of the Porte, the invasion of the island by Greece,
and the war which ensued between Turkey and Greece, in which the
latter so quickly collapsed, have proved, thus far, to be disturbances
severely localised by means of the Concert established among the
Great Powers, who, while resolved to compel the Sultan&rsquo;s Government
to administer his realm with humanity and even justice, have resisted
the attempt made by the Greeks to wrest away part of his territory
by violence.</p>

<p>The affairs of the Transvaal rose into prominent notice towards
the close of 1895. Commercial enterprise had for some time been
actively directed towards South Africa, notably by the British South Africa Company, at the head
of which was Mr. Cecil Rhodes, the Premier of the Cape Colony, who had been sworn a member
of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Privy Council.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Trouble in the Transvaal.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Miners and settlers in general poured into the
Transvaal to the number of 60,000, converting the quiet village of Johannesburg
into a large and busy town. The Transvaal Government viewed this movement
with no favour; the industry of the Boer population was chiefly a pastoral one, and President
Krüger steadily refused to comply with the claim of the new-comers to rights of citizenship. The
Uitlanders, as the new settlers were called, numbered three to one of the native Boers, and were
paying nine-tenths of the taxation:
meetings, summoned
to protest against the action
of the President and Volksraad,
were prohibited; a deaf
ear was turned to all petitions
for redress, and, at last, a
movement was started to
obtain by compulsion what
was refused by law. A force
of all arms, commanded by
Dr. Jameson, and comprising
several officers in the British
service, invaded the Transvaal
in the expectation of a concerted
rising in Johannesburg.
This did not take place: after
a smart encounter with the
Boers, the English force surrendered
on January 1, 1896.
The principal officers were
put on their trial under the
Foreign Enlistment Act, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
sentenced to various terms of imprisonment, and, in some instances, to forfeiture of their commissions.
The claim for indemnity put forward by the Government of the South African Republic has not yet
been settled. A Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to investigate the origin
and conduct of what has become known as the &ldquo;Johannesburg movement,&rdquo; and its enquiry is still
proceeding. Perhaps the most important result of the Transvaal raid will prove to be the insight
suddenly afforded into the true sentiments of the German Government towards Great Britain. The
numerous bonds uniting the German and British Courts, added to the racial sympathies existing
between the two nations, had given rise to the belief that the policy of Germany was more friendly
towards Great Britain than that of some of the other great Powers. This belief was rudely dispelled
by a message from the German Emperor to President Krüger encouraging him in resistance in any
dispute that might arise with the British Government.</p>

<p>While the trouble with the Transvaal was still pending, there came a still more formidable
surprise from a quarter whence it was little expected. A controversy between Great Britain and the
insignificant South American Republic of Venezuela had been dragging its course
for many years on the subject of a disputed frontier between the latter country
and British Guiana.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Venezuelan Dispute.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Suddenly, on December 17, President Cleveland startled the
world by a message to Congress declaring that the action of the British Government in this matter was
an infringement of the Monroe doctrine; that it was the duty of Congress to resist the infringement
of that doctrine, and that a Commission should be appointed by the Executive to examine and report
on the rights of the case. Then, continued the President, it would be &ldquo;the duty of the United States to
resist by every means in its power, as a wilful aggression upon its rights and interests, the appropriation by
Great Britain of any lands which, after investigation, may be determined of right to belong to Venezuela.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was open menace, and it required the utmost forbearance on the part of the British Cabinet
to avoid precipitating a conflict. Finally, the question of the Venezuelan Frontier was referred to
arbitration, and diplomacy seems in a fair way to earn one of its best merited triumphs.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">AN EARLY BICYCLE.</p>

<p>This is probably the earliest Bicycle seen in England;
it was made in 1868 by Mr. W. F. Martin.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>First, as to locomotion: when Sir Walter Scott was writing the opening chapters of the &ldquo;Heart
of Midlothian,&rdquo; in 1818, he referred to the wonderful development of facilities for travel, and may have
thought he was exceeding the limits of the probable when he penned the sentence: &ldquo;Perhaps the
echoes of Ben Nevis may soon be awakened by the bugle, not of a warlike chieftain, but of the guard
of a mail coach.&rdquo; Scott was by no means deficient in imaginative
power, but the maximum speed he can have contemplated
was ten miles an hour, for the standard of speed in those days
was the pace of a horse (we still reckon the strength of our
engines at so many &ldquo;horse&rdquo; power).
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Modern Locomotion.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
What would he think
now, were it possible for him to take his seat in a luxurious
saloon and be whirled round the flanks of
Ben Nevis, along the West Highland Railway?
Eleven years after the publication of the &ldquo;Heart of
Midlothian&rdquo; a competition of locomotives was held on the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and the prize was taken
by Messrs. Stephenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rocket.&rdquo; Weighing 7 tons 9 cwts.,
this engine was able to draw a load of 9 tons 10 cwts. at an
average speed of thirteen miles an hour. One of the first-class
express engines on the London and North-Western line at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
present day weighs 77 tons 2 cwts., and draws a load of 160 tons, at an average speed of forty-seven
miles an hour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 186px;">
<img src="images/xp185-1.jpg" width="186" height="290" alt="" />

<div class="caption"> GEORGE STEPHENSON,<br />1781&ndash;1848.

<p>Railway Engineer. Born at Wylam, Northumberland.
Son of a colliery fireman. Constructed his
first locomotive in 1814. Planned and constructed
the first railways&mdash;Stockton and Darlington, 1815&ndash;25,
Liverpool and Manchester, 1825&ndash;30. Was chief
engineer to most of the lines constructed until 1840,
when he retired, leaving his business to his son
Robert.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it is not only by steam that the standard of speed in locomotion has been displaced.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Bicycle.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The invention and constant improvement of the bicycle has not only
caused the rise of a most important industry in their manufacture
(about half a million cycles are being turned
out of the factories annually, representing a
value of at least £5,000,000), but it has supplied a means of locomotion
of incalculable convenience to persons of all classes and of
both sexes. This invention must be reckoned a great boon, not
only as a means of recreation to persons in crowded towns, to
whom the cycle affords easy access to the country, but also to
working-men living at a distance from their employment.</p>

<p>With respect to the mechanical propulsion of carriages along
ordinary streets and highways, stringent regulations were in force
until 1896, under which such carriages were not permitted to travel
at a higher speed than four miles an hour.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Motor Carriages.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But the invention of &ldquo;motor&rdquo; carriages, propelled
by steam, gas, oil, or electricity, convinced the authorities that
these restrictions should be relaxed. This accordingly was done
by Act of Parliament, and their removal was celebrated, on November
14, 1896, by the excursion of a number of horseless carriages
from London to Brighton. Evil weather marred the display,
nevertheless large numbers of persons turned out to witness it.
It is too early to predict the extent to which horses may be displaced
by motor carriages, but it can scarcely be doubtful that their obvious
imperfections will yield to the ingenuity of inventors, so as to
render them at least dangerous rivals to the old kind of equipage.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of terrestrial locomotion, allusion must be made to the project of
carrying a tunnel under the Straits of Dover to the French coast, to enable trains to be run without
interruption from Great Britain to the Continent.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Proposed Channel Tunnel.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The tunnel, the favourite
scheme of Sir Edward Watkin, Chairman of the South-Eastern Railway, was
begun some years ago, and was actually carried for several hundred yards under
the sea. But the strategic advantages of an island realm are too substantial to be sacrificed by
the creation of a highway, command
of which would certainly
be insisted on by any Power or
combination of Powers which, in
the future, might overcome Great
Britain in arms.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Steam Navigation.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Turning now to loco&shy;motion
by sea, or navigation, steam had
been applied to the propulsion of
vessels as early as 1802, and its
use had been
gradually extended
till, in 1835, the first
steamer with mails for Egypt and
India was despatched from Falmouth;
but it was not until the
second year of the present reign,
1838, that the first vessel entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
propelled by steam crossed the Atlantic.
Greatly as the appearance and strength of our mercantile
marine fleet has been altered to meet the requirement of speed, a still greater contrast is presented in
the construction of warships since the invention of rifled ordnance. When our Queen ascended the
throne, the famous wooden walls of Old England were moved by sails
alone. Greater speed was subsequently secured by the introduction
of engine room to vessels of the old type, with paddles or screw-propellers.
But experience proved how easily engines might be thrown
out of gear by a single shot, a danger which grew more imminent
with every fresh improvement in guns.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Ironclads.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Then began the long contest
between armour-plating and projectiles: the armour had to be made
thicker and ever thicker to resist the increasing
weight and velocity of projectiles, until, by the
reduction of masts and spars to the bare necessities of signalling,
the submergence of the hull to reduce the vulnerable surface, the
increase of engine space, and the reduction of the armament to a
few pieces of great power, our battleships have lost almost all
semblance of the fabrics which used to move in such stately manner
under towers of canvas, and have acquired the character of floating
forts. Still, Britannia rules the waves; her seamen, of whom it
was predicted that the adoption of steam would deprive of their
superiority, have no equals in the world; and her people have
proved, by their enthusiasm in furnishing the necessary funds, that
they will endure almost any sacrifice rather than suffer the British
Navy to be second in power to any other.</p>

The revolution in intercourse between distant places effected by the electric telegraph has been
noticed already, but even that has been outdone in rapidity by later applications of the electric
current; for, just as spoken language is swifter than written words, so the telephone
has overcome the limits hitherto imposed by space on conversation.
It was a great marvel when, in 1852, the completion of a cable under the Channel rendered communication
possible between London and Paris by means of a code of signals; but now statesmen and
commercial men may discuss affairs confidentially by telephone; nay, a lover in Paris may listen
with rapture to the very accents of his beloved
lingering in London.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Phonograph.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
One of the most remarkable modifications of
the telephone is Edison&rsquo;s phonograph, whereby
the human voice and other sounds are recorded on
a delicate membrane, which
afterwards, for an indefinite
period, is capable of being made to repeat or transmit
these sounds. Future generations will be able
thereby to listen to the actual voice and accents
of the departed.</p>

<p>Not the least important of the recent modes

At the beginning of the reign the streets of London
and other towns, as well as
many of the houses, were lit
by gas; though as late as
fifteen years ago it was still the custom in some
old-fashioned hotels to charge half-a-guinea for the
use of a pair of wax candles. But the invention of
an illuminant which neither exhausts nor pollutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
the air breathed by human beings, nor involves risk of accidental conflagration, which is easily
manageable and throws off no smoke and very little heat, has been one of the benefits conferred by
science so characteristic of this age.</p>

The researches of Daguerre and
Nicéphore de Niepce had established, before
Queen Victoria ascended the throne,
the possibility of obtaining permanent
images by the action
of light on silver-plated
copper, but the first notable
advance in the new art of photography
was the invention of the calotype by
Fox Talbot, who applied iodide of silver
to paper, which was rendered sensitive
to light by further treatment. Then, in
1850, came the collodion process, and
the subsequent discovery of dry-plate
processes brought photography within
easy compass of amateurs, and greatly
enhanced the value of photography as an
aid to science. The exposure of thirty
minutes, required under the Daguerrotype
process, has been reduced to one-fifteenth
of a second by the use of
gelatine emulsion. The latest manifestation of photographic skill is certainly very marvellous, namely,
the kinematograph. By a rapid succession of instantaneous exposures a series of plates is obtained
so closely consecutive that when the images are reflected in equally rapid succession upon a screen,
men and animals may be seen the size of life in natural movement.</p>

<p>Photography has had a powerful effect on the art of painting, not only by the cheap reproduction
of acknowledged masterpieces, which is not without risk of encouraging conventional&shy;ism in design,
but by creating a more exacting standard of fidelity to nature.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Its Effect on Painting and Engraving.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
While it has caused some painters to
seek after intense realism, it has
led others to
a reactionary
course
which they term impressionism.
Judging roughly from the vast
numbers of pictures painted and
exhibited each year, and from the
immense prices given for the
works of favourite masters, both
living and dead, it is difficult to
believe that, however great may
be the aggregate expenditure by
the purchasing public on photographs,
it has interfered appreciably
with the sale of pictures.</p>

<p>One branch of art certainly
has suffered by the rivalry of
sun pictures, namely, the various
kinds of engraving. Wood-engraving,
indeed, had already run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
to seed during the present century, from the affectation of craftsmen to a freedom and rapidity of which
the material was not really capable: but engraving on copper and steel, etching, lithography, and,
above all, mezzotint engraving (said to have been the joint invention
of Prince Rupert and one of his officers named Siegen), had
lost none of their delicacy and power when photography invaded
their province. Excellent results are obtained from the best
methods of photogravure and photolithography, and, where absolute
accuracy of detail is required,
they leave little to
be desired; but the extent
to which cheap &ldquo;process&rdquo;
plates have supplanted the
older arts of book illustration
affords much to
deplore from an artistic
standpoint.</p>

<p>In one respect the
reign of Queen Victoria
offers a strange and rather melancholy contrast to all that have
preceded it, inasmuch as it is the first during
which the architects of this country have been
totally destitute of any peculiar style of building.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Victorian Architecture.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Never were builders more ingenious or more skilful, never was there such vast
expenditure in the erection of private or public buildings, but never
before were architects so completely reliant on the past for design. Is it proposed to build a church, a
public institution, or a dwelling-house? If you have the money you shall have one as well built as
human hands can accomplish. But you must name your style&mdash;Greek, Palladian, Norman, Early
English, Tudor, Jacobean, or Georgian&mdash;your architect will carry out a masterpiece in any one of
them; but if you say Victorian, or the style of the day, he will give you
François I<span class="fnanchor">er</span> to-day, Queen
Anne to-morrow, and Pericles the day after. Buildings grow apace, and they are soundly and
tastefully constructed, but British architecture is dead.</p>

<p>The same may be said of design in general. People of taste look with horror upon the fashions
of the early years of the reign; the heavy mahogany furniture, the flowered wall-papers, the tapestry,
the plate, the ornaments, are all condemned as barbarous; and the mode consists of Chippendale
and Sheraton furniture and so-called &ldquo;art&rdquo; fabrics and papers. But how
little this depends on more than fleeting fancy may be seen when it is
considered how the taste has changed within a few years in the matter of
table-glass. Ten years ago nothing would please
but blown glass of the thinnest; Mr. Ruskin
convinced us that the two qualities of glass
which should be emphasised in the design were
transparency and ductility. But we have thrown
that doctrine to the winds now, and a visit to
one of the leading warehouses will show how completely
we have reverted to the brilliant, many-facetted
bottles and glasses of fifty years ago.</p>

<p>It is natural, in considering the phenomenon
of a great nation wholly without any stable principles
to guide it in art, to
ask what has the State done
during sixty years in the matter of public education?
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Universal Education.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Ask rather, what it has left undone!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Certainly our rulers cannot be charged either with negligence or parsimony in this respect. Five
years before the accession of Queen Victoria not a shilling of money was voted by Parliament towards
elementary education. In 1833, for
the first time, a grant of £20,000
was made for that purpose; at the
present day the vote annually made
for Education, Science, and Art exceeds
ten millions. Even this is not
enough to satisfy some people, as was
made plain by the question addressed
by an elector to a candidate for a
Scottish constituency at a recent
election. &ldquo;Is Maister Wilson,&rdquo; asked
this enthusiast, &ldquo;in favour of spending
£36,000,000 a year on the Airmy,
and only £12,000,000 on eddication?
That&rsquo;s to say, twelve millions for pittin&rsquo;
brains into folks&rsquo; heads, and thirty-six
millions for blawin&rsquo; them oot.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">MANCHESTER TOWN HALL.</p>

<p>During the present reign most of our leading towns have built handsome and commodious Town
Halls. That of Manchester, designed by Mr. Alfred Waterhouse, R.A., is a well-known example. It
was opened in 1877. Its clock-tower is 285 feet high; the interior of the hall is decorated with
historical paintings by Ford Madox Brown.</p>

</div>

<p>A generation has grown up under
universal compulsory education, and
it is possible already to calculate
some of the effects of that far-reaching measure on the material prosperity, moral character, and
literary habits of our people. In regard to the first two, statistics go to show that, notwithstanding
an increase of nearly 35 per cent. in the population since the introduction of compulsory education
in 1871, there had been a decrease between that year and 1894 of nearly 25 per cent. in the number
of paupers, from 1,079,391 to 812,441. The convictions for crime showed a corresponding diminution
from 12,953 to 9,634, or rather more than 25 per cent.; while, during a similar period, the number
of &ldquo;juvenile offenders&rdquo; had been reduced to the enormous extent of over 71½ per cent.</p>

<p>This is the only Anglican Cathedral built in England during the Queen&rsquo;s reign. The foundation-stone
was laid by the Prince of Wales, May 20, 1880, and the Cathedral was opened in his Royal
Highness&rsquo;s presence, November 3, 1887. A portion of the nave and the central tower have yet
to be built. The architect is Mr. J. L. Pearson, R.A.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>As to the impulse given to the demand for literature by the extension of education, there need be
no doubt whatever; the enormous supply continually pouring from the press of the country is sufficient
proof of that. In respect of books, the returns from the numerous public libraries in the country
show that works of fiction are in request far beyond all the other branches of literature put together.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Predominance of Fiction.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Some sinister conclusions have been
drawn from that
fact, but it is not
always remembered
that most of those who frequent free
libraries are hard-working people, who
turn to books for recreation rather than
instruction. On the whole, English fiction
remains wholesome, a result which,
notwithstanding the democratic nature of
our Constitution, is owing, undoubtedly,
in large measure to the tone maintained
in her Court by our present Monarch.</p>

<p>This spacious but unimposing building occupies the site on which, a few years ago, stood
the Clerkenwell House of Correction. Parcel postage was first introduced on August 1, 1883,
and the number of parcels forwarded between post offices in the United Kingdom during the
succeeding twelve months was about 25,000,000. During twelve months of 1895&ndash;96 the number
of &ldquo;inland&rdquo; parcels despatched reached the enormous total of 60,500,000.</p>

<p>That ephemeral, but not the less
potent, form of literature known as the
Press, may be said almost truly to be the
creation of the Victorian age. Newspapers,
as we know them, are the outcome
of two circumstances, the removal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
of the paper tax in 1861 and the spread
of telegraphic communication.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Growth of Journalism.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Every industry, every sect, every amuse&shy;ment,
every shade of opinion, now has its
special organs in the
press; and perhaps
nothing is more remarkable
than the enterprise and high
quality of the provincial journals, as distinguished
from those published in the
Metropolis. British journalism differs in
several important respects from that of
all other European countries. In the
first place, it is absolutely free: there
is nothing approaching a censorship of
the Press, and in those rare instances in
which, during the present reign, publishers
have been interfered with by the State,
as has occasionally happened in Ireland,
the offence has not been a political one,
but such incitement to crime or disorder
as would be punishable in any private
individual. It is matter for just pride that this liberty is exceedingly seldom abused. Another point
of difference is that the British Government
has no official or semi-official organ
in the press. Official announcements
are communicated, when necessary, to
press agencies, and through them find
their way into journals of all shades of
politics. Lastly, the British press has
maintained, as a rule, its impersonality.
There has been a slight tendency of
recent years to exchange the editorial
&ldquo;we&rdquo; for a more familiar style, but
this has been confined so far to journals
of little influence. Leading articles and
critical reviews are almost invariably
anonymous, whereas in France the weight
attached to these is proportioned to the
repute of the name by which they are
signed. In order to give some idea of
the daily output of the newspaper press
in London alone the following instance
may be given:&mdash;On Monday, February 13,
1893, Mr. Gladstone introduced his second
Home Rule Bill in the House of Commons.
On the following morning there were despatched
from a single establishment, that
of W. H. Smith and Son, 374,218 newspapers,
weighing upwards of 44 tons.</p>

The introduction of
anæsthetics has been mentioned in
an earlier chapter; the present year,
1897, is the jubilee anniversary of that blessed event.
The vaccination laws were consolidated in 1871, and
universal vaccination insisted on, with the result that a
loathsome disease, which formerly brought unspeakable
misery upon all civilised nations has been practically
vanquished. The deaths from small-pox in England,
which, at the close of the last century, were reckoned at
3,000 per million, had sunk in the decade from 1878&ndash;87
to 54 per million. Attempts have been made persistently
by a small minority to resist compulsory
vaccination. Persons inclined to listen to arguments
against this legislation on the score of undue interference with liberty, should study the Report of
the Local Government Board upon an outbreak of small-pox in
Sheffield in 1887&ndash;88. Of 6,088 persons
attacked 590 died; among children
under ten years of age, 5 per 1,000 of
those vaccinated were attacked and
·09 per 1,000 died; of the unvaccinated,
101 per 1,000 were attacked
and 44 per 1,000 died.</p>

<p>Born 1827. Discovered the antiseptic method

</div>

<p>Although it is the name of a
Frenchman, the late M. Pasteur,
which is most conspicuously associated
with recent progress in pathology,
it was Sir Joseph (now Lord) Lister
who was led by Pasteur&rsquo;s researches
into the theory of fermentation to discover
the antiseptic system of surgery.
He employed carbolic acid, previously
known as little more than a laboratory
product, in destroying microbes which
had found access to a wound, and thereby
first made surgery scientific. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Lister did more than that; the antiseptic treatment
was superseded in turn by the aseptic, in which, by
sterilising everything that might come in contact with
wounds, access was refused altogether to microbes, and
henceforward operations surpassing the most ambitious
dreams of the old school of surgery were rendered
possible. From the work of Pasteur and Lister has
arisen the science of bacteriology, which, in the hands
of Professor Koch, of Berlin, and others, is being developed
into the systematic &ldquo;cultivation&rdquo; of the germs
of specific diseases.</p>

It may be difficult to decide which has had
most hand in the good result already shown in the mortality
returns, legislators or men of science; at all events, they are
worthy rivals. The annual death-rate in England during the first
ten years of the present reign was 22·4 per 1,000; it was a
shade higher in the decade from 1861&ndash;70, standing at 22·5 per
1,000. Then came the age of sanitation and the dawn of bacteriology;
the death-rate sank in 1871&ndash;80 to 21·4 per 1,000, and in

<p>British surgeons have not been slow to avail themselves
of the discovery, by Professor Röntgen, of certain
non-luminous rays beyond the spectrum, which are
capable of penetrating substances hitherto considered
impermeable. By laying such a structure as a human
limb upon a properly sensitised surface, and exposing it
to these rays thrown from a tube excited by electricity,
a permanent image is obtained of the bones and denser
portions of the structure. By this means the exact
position of any foreign substance, such as a bullet or
needle, or the nature of a dislocation or fracture, may
be ascertained with precision; and already it has been
found possible to examine the condition of the internal
organs of a living person.</p>

<p>In bringing to a close this brief survey of the reign of twelve
lustres&mdash;the longest reign in the history of Great Britain&mdash;we
may note with gratitude that not one of the many influences
that have contributed to the moral or material well-being of the
subjects of the empire shows any sign of abating in force. It is a
task of no little difficulty and complexity to reconcile the rival,
and sometimes conflicting, interests arising in a vast population,
and, at the same time, to maintain our lead in the competitive
industry of nations; yet it is one which the personal character of the Monarch, in conjunction with
the constitutional development of the last sixty years justify the Legislature in undertaking with
courage and good hope.</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="dropleft3">W</span>E have traced the history of our great Queen down to the point where her Record
Reign reaches its culmination in the festivities of June, 1897. Nothing now
remains but to give some account of these Imperial celebrations&mdash;Imperial in the
truest sense of the word, because faithful subjects of Her Majesty, of every colour
and every creed, came from the four corners of the most majestic Empire that has
ever existed to pay homage to the Lady Ruler over all. Pen and pencil must necessarily

reader of these words may rely upon it that our account is true in every detail. Such a record will
be found useful not only by those who actually took part in the Diamond Jubilee festivities and who
wish to refresh their memories, but also by those to whom they will be matter of history.</p>

<p>The possibilities of a great celebration in 1897 were first discussed after the Jubilee of 1887,
although it was not until 1896 that public interest was thoroughly aroused in the great event. Men
felt vaguely that the sixtieth anniversary of the reign of the best-beloved of all British Sovereigns
demanded an especial effort on the part of all loyal subjects; but as to the manner in which the
event should be celebrated, opinions were as various as the men who gave utterance to them. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
only definite desire was in everybody&rsquo;s heart&mdash;that the Queen should come down among her people
and receive their congratulations in person. This was the central idea round which all schemes
clustered, and this was the idea to which the Queen gave her sanction. In March of 1897 it
was officially proclaimed that Her Majesty would go
in procession to St. Paul&rsquo;s to offer up her thanks
to the Supreme Being for all the blessings of her
long reign.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">THE RIGHT HON. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN.</p>

<p>Born in London in 1836. He was educated at University College School,
and afterwards joined his father, who was a member of the firm of Nettlefold and
Chamberlain, screw manufacturers, of Birmingham. He was elected Chairman of
the Birmingham Education League in 1868, member of the Town Council in the
same year, and of the School Board in 1870; of the last he became Chairman in 1873.
He was Mayor of Birmingham during the years 1874&ndash;75-76, and has represented
that town in Parliament since 1876. He accepted the Presidency of the Board
of Trade with a seat in Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Cabinet in 1880, and in 1886 the
Presidency of the Local Government Board, but resigned in March of that
year when his political chief declared in favour of Home Rule for Ireland.
After the general election of 1895 he became Secretary of State for the Colonies
in Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s Administration. He is the Leader in the House of Commons
of the Liberal wing of the Unionist Party. He married (as his third wife)
Miss Endicott, an American lady, in 1888.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>And here let honour be rendered to whom
honour is due. From the Colonial Secretary,
Mr. Chamberlain, emanated the action which gave
the event its Imperial character&mdash;the invitation of
the Colonial Premiers and the representative detachments
of men from the
various forces of Colonial and
other troops serving under her
throughout our world-wide Empire.

but we have other forces across the seas, small it
may be in numbers, but magnificent in physique
and all that constitutes martial efficiency, whose
presence on such an occasion would add lustre
and a peculiar significance to the great function.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our grey old London set about
adorning itself for the great event. To transform
a working city like London into a temporary fairyland
is a task of herculean proportions, but it
was done! The Corporation voted £25,000 to a
decoration fund, and the most moderate estimate
fixes the cost of London&rsquo;s holiday garb at £250,000. Venetian masts appeared suddenly in all the
streets along which the procession was to make its way; and as the fateful day drew near, festoons of
flowers and loyal inscriptions were suspended from these. Cunningly concealed in the hanging bouquets
of flowers were electric lamps destined
to make the streets even more brilliant
at night than they were in the daytime.</p>

festoons of evergreens, from which hung baskets of rare flowers, birds in flight, and globes of red, white,

turned the roadway into a pathway of quivering light.</p>

were literally outlined with tiny gas and electric light
lamps. The Fire Monument and other public monuments
came in for special decorative attention, and
in some cases hundreds of pounds were spent in
beautifying them for the great show.</p>

<p>In Victoria Street the offices of the various Colonies were alive with colour, and even the south
side of the river, where loyalty is
more abundant than money, was gay
with its decorations, in the form of
golden eagles with outstretched wings,
and lines of real flowers stretched
across the thoroughfares on invisible
wires.</p>

<p>But the generous efforts of Civic
and Parish authorities were not a
whit more remarkable than those of
private individuals. Many of the
houses along the route of the procession
were covered with decorations
from cellar to attic. The colour
generally chosen was red, but in
some instances costly materials of
delicate shades were used. Draperies
of brilliant hues were hung from
almost every window, so that some
of the streets resembled theatres
rather than the busy thoroughfares
of a busy city.</p>

<p>Born at St. Lin, Quebec, 1841. Educated for the

1871 he entered the Legislature of Quebec, and, three

his speeches had been delivered in French; he now
spoke in English with equal eloquence. He became

<p>Nor were the decorations confined
to the streets. Every errand
boy wore his Jubilee favour days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
before the event. From every whip fluttered a little pennant of
the national colour. Scarcely a bicycle passed that had not on
its handle-bar gay streamers of red, white, and blue, and even the
practical top-hatted city man sported in his button-hole the colours
which rule the world.</p>

<p>Long before these preparations were completed, the invasion
of London by visitors from the country, from America, and from
the Continent had commenced.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Influx of Visitors.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The streets, always pretty-well congested with the great
press of traffic, were now almost impassable. Vast good-humoured
crowds surged up and down the principal thoroughfares, and
travelling from one part of the town to another became a matter
of increasing difficulty. Where all the people were accommodated
it would be difficult to say. Certain it is, that all the rooms in
the better-known hotels were taken weeks beforehand, and the
landladies of Bloomsbury reaped a rich harvest.</p>

<p>In addition to the vast amount of accommodation afforded
by the houses lying along the route, every available coign of
vantage was seized upon for the
erection of a stand. Churches
were lost to view beneath vast
tiers of red upholstered seats
reaching half way up their
towers, and what had been
known as Charing Cross Station was buried from sight under a
mammoth thousand-seated stand.

One of the largest stands was in Whitehall opposite the Horse Guards.<a name="FNanchor_I" id="FNanchor_I"></a><a href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">I</a> A large number of
carpenters were employed for more than six weeks in its erection; £7,000 was paid to the Woods

contained some 4,000 seats, which were advertised at from four to twenty guineas. It was built into
foundations of solid concrete from three feet to six feet thick, and contained 150 tons of timber and
fifteen tons of forty-five feet steel girders; 5,000 chairs were specially purchased for its equipment
and, besides the seats, it contained promenades, reception rooms, a luncheon room for the accommodation
of 400 people, ladies&rsquo; rooms, telephones, and a smoking gallery.</p>

<p>Another huge stand was that erected in the churchyard of St. Martin&rsquo;s Church, Charing Cross.

<p class="alone in0 center">THE PROCESSION OF IMPERIAL AND COLONIAL TROOPS, June&nbsp;19.</p>

<p>What was in effect a dress rehearsal of the Jubilee procession took place on the Saturday preceding
that event, when the Life Guards, the Dragoon Guards, Horse and Field Artillery, and Colonial Mounted
Troops assembled at Victoria Park, and marched by Grove Road, Mile End Road, and Whitechapel, to the
Mansion House. The picture represents the South Australian Lancers leaving the Park. The troops, and
particularly the Colonials, were received with the greatest enthusiasm by the immense crowds which lined
the route. It was a happy idea to give the East End this opportunity of welcoming the Colonists.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>There were many other stands
of colossal size, but that which
represented the most enterprising
speculation of the celebration was
undoubtedly the colossal stand on
the north side of St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard.<a name="FNanchor_J" id="FNanchor_J"></a><a href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">J</a>
For the purpose of its erection
one of the most valuable city
properties was purchased and pulled
down. The seats in these various
stands were offered at fabulous
prices, but the public refused to
purchase, and the venture resulted
in a heavy loss to its promoters,
as indeed did most of the speculations
in seats. However, very large
sums indeed were paid to witness
the procession, £2,000 being offered
and accepted for the use of a building
in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard for
the day. In some cases the vendors
offered prizes ranging from £50 downwards
to purchasers of their seats.</p>

<p>On June 11 the official programme was published, and henceforth the sole topic in men&rsquo;s minds
was Jubilee Day and its doings. Previous to this, however, the most elaborate precautions had been
taken to ensure the safety of the multitude of sightseers, and to guard against any hitch occurring
in the actual procession.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the guests of the Nation began to arrive from every part of the World. The Prime
Ministers of our great dependencies in Australasia, in South Africa, and Canada, were lodged in the
palatial Hotel Cecil; the foreign princes and their suites were accommodated in the Royal Palaces
and in private mansions rented or lent for the occasion, while the detachments of troops from the
various self-governing and Crown Colonies were billeted at Chelsea Hospital, at Hounslow, and
at Woolwich. The Indian officers composing the deputation from the Imperial Service Troops, and the
British officers in charge, were lodged at the &ldquo;Star and Garter&rdquo; Hotel at Richmond. It is impossible
to convey any impression of the hospitality that was now lavished on our honoured guests. While
the troopers of the Colonial forces were being fêted by Tommy Atkins and the Volunteers of London,
the Colonial Premiers were the lions of the great houses of the Metropolis. &ldquo;He died from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
effects of British hospitality&rdquo; is the humorous epitaph composed for himself, in the event of that
casualty, by the Right Honourable G. H. Reid, Premier of New South Wales. Royal carriages and
Royal servants were placed at the disposal of visitors of high rank; but it is certain that the genuine
enthusiasm of their reception among the millions of London was even more highly valued by our
distinguished visitors than these marks of Royal favour.</p>

<div class="caption">THE ROYAL TRAIN ON THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY, SPECIALLY FITTED UP FOR THE JUBILEE OCCASION.</div>
</div>

<p>While the good citizens of London were entertaining the guests of the Nation and getting their
houses in order for the culminating function of June 22, there was ever present in their minds a fear
lest the great festival would be marred by a catastrophe such as that which threw a black shadow
over the Coronation of the Czar. It was vaguely felt that the vast
multitudes that would throng the streets on that day might become
unmanageable&mdash;that some of the temporary stands would collapse,
or that the great pressure of the massed crowds at certain points
would result in disaster.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Precautions against Accidents.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
It is due entirely to the sagacity and foresight of the authorities that the
streets were never more safe than they were
on June 22, and that not a single life was lost in consequence of
the Jubilee arrangements. Temporary stands were examined&mdash;and
where faulty condemned&mdash;again and again by the officials of the
London County Council and of the Corporation, and the most
scrupulous care was taken
that there should not be
gathered at any one point
a larger number of persons
than could be easily controlled.</p>

PROCESSION OF THE LORD CHANCELLOR AND PEERS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>To make assurance doubly sure several rehearsals of the great Service at St. Paul&rsquo;s, and the
business of taking up and setting down at Buckingham Palace were held; and so complete were these
rehearsals, that every item of the procession was fully represented, mounted grooms taking the places
of the princes and equerries who were to ride on horseback in the procession. In the final rehearsals
many of those who were destined to high places in the procession were present, and there was a
large demand for seats to view in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard.</p>

<p>So that the day might be one of universal rejoicing all over the country, it had been declared,
on March 18, a public holiday by Her Majesty in the following proclamation:&mdash;&ldquo;Victoria, R.&mdash;We,
considering that it is desirable that
Tuesday, the twenty-second day of
June next, should be observed as a
Bank Holiday throughout the United
Kingdom, do hereby, by and with the
advice of Our Privy Council, and in
pursuance of the provisions of &lsquo;The
Bank Holidays Act, 1871,&rsquo; appoint
Tuesday, the twenty-second day of
June next, as a special day to be
observed as a Bank Holiday throughout
the United Kingdom, and every
part thereof, and we do by this Our
Royal Proclamation command the said
day to be so observed, and all Our
loving subjects to order themselves
accordingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actual celebrations may be
said to have commenced on Sunday, June 20.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Thanksgiving Services.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This, being Accession Day,
was marked by a universal service
of thanksgiving throughout the
Empire, in addition to the four Special
Services, which must ever be memorable
in British history: the Royal
Service at St. George&rsquo;s Chapel, Windsor,
the great National Service at
St. Paul&rsquo;s, and the Services at Westminster
Abbey and St. Margaret&rsquo;s,
Westminster, at which the Peers and
Commons were present.</p>

<p>The Service at Windsor was of the simplest description. The Queen drove from the Victoria
Tower at 11 o&rsquo;clock to the entrance to the Dean&rsquo;s Cloister. Thence she was taken in a wheel-chair
to the north-east door of the Chapel. She entered the north door of the Choir leaning on the arm of
an Indian attendant. The Queen&rsquo;s chair was placed on the broad step at the foot of the beautiful
altar, which she faced throughout the impressive Service. Besides members of the Royal family and
suites, there were but few privileged visitors. The Service was arranged and conducted by Dean Eliot,
and it began with the hymn, &ldquo;Now thank we all our God.&rdquo; The Te Deum was sung according to
a very striking setting composed by the late Prince Consort, one which is not often used, but which
was given on this occasion by special command of Her Majesty. The Service concluded with &ldquo;God
Save the Queen,&rdquo; sung by the choir and congregation. The very simplicity of the scene was its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
impressiveness. It required a great effort of the imagination to fully comprehend it all&mdash;that the little
old lady sitting there in quiet black before the altar was she who, sixty years ago, was awakened
from her sleep in Kensington Palace to wear the crown of a world-wide Empire.</p>

<p>On Monday, June 21, the Queen travelled up to London from Windsor.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Queen arrives.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
At half-past twelve the
Royal train glided gently into Paddington Station with the Royal Standard proudly
waving at the front of the engine, and the Royal coat of arms on either side.</p>

<p>Extraordinary arrangements had been made to secure Her Majesty&rsquo;s comfort and safety, and had
there been an accident it would not have been due to the absence of competent officers, for besides
the Royal party the train contained the head and front of the Great Western Railway, from the
Chairman, Viscount Emlyn, and the Directors downward.</p>

<p>The Queen was dressed in black except for the white egret plumes in her bonnet, and it was
noticeable that, notwithstanding her great age, she seemed in the best of health and spirits, and fully
equal to the strain of the morrow.</p>

<p>A halt was made while Marylebone&rsquo;s loyal address was presented, and then the Queen moved on

brilliant morning and a brilliant reception&mdash;a foretaste
of the morrow. While the crowds of sightseers
spent the rest of the day in wandering through the
gaily-bedecked streets, Buckingham Palace was the
scene of receptions, banqueting, and rejoicing.</p>

graciously accepted a sunshade

</div>
</div>

<p>At nightfall, an inhabitant of London who had known it in more prosaic times might well have
been pardoned for thinking the whole Nation were mad and had turned the Metropolis into Bedlam.
Vast armies of excited people invaded the streets
and, in spite of the fatigues that must have
been endured, comported themselves most admirably.
There was little prospect of their
getting home. But no one cared. Why should
they? They had come to see the Jubilee, some
of them from the uttermost
ends of the earth, and see
the Jubilee they would, though they spent the
night in the streets&mdash;and thousands of them did
so spend the night.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Night in the Streets.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Some possibly had been
unable to secure sleeping accommodation, others
evidently thought it scarcely worth while to
return to distant suburbs when it would be
necessary for them to be up and doing early the
next morning. As the short night broke into
day clusters of people were seen grouped round
the base of the Arch, on Constitution Hill, at
Hyde Park Corner, and in Trafalgar Square.
Hundreds took their stand on the kerb all along
the route, and waited patiently. If they had
but known it these loyal souls might have saved
themselves so much trouble&mdash;for if there was one thing about Jubilee Day more remarkable than another,
it was the complete absence of undue crowding in the streets. Those who strolled down to Piccadilly,
St. James&rsquo;s Street, Fleet Street, or the Strand two or three hours before the Procession started,
were as well able to witness the most impressive pageant
that London has ever seen as those whose eagerness led
them to take up their positions four or five hours earlier.
The route was long, and the spectators, except at points of
convergence like Hyde Park Corner and Ludgate Circus,
well distributed throughout its entire length, while many
hundreds of thousands were accommodated in the houses;
but this only partially explains the complete immunity from
uncomfortable crushing enjoyed by those who lined the
streets. The fact is,
that a very large
number of Londoners
fearing the crowd, and
apprehensive perhaps
of extreme fatigue and
even of actual danger,
migrated from the
Metropolis and spent
the day in the country
or at the seaside. It is
beyond doubt, moreover,
that London
crowds grow more orderly
and manageable
year by year.</p>

most sanguine feared that &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Weather&rdquo; was not to be looked for on the most
momentous day in the great little lady&rsquo;s life. As a matter of fact, the sky on the
morning of June 22 was dull and overcast; and it was not until the scarlet coats of
the soldiers lined each side of the roadway along the seven-mile route with warm
colour that the expectant, buzzing multitude gave itself up to an unqualified enjoyment of the day.
But the very elements conspired to add splendour to the great festival of the Queen. It is a curious
circumstance that at &ldquo;the very moment when the head of the Queen&rsquo;s Procession came through the
archway into the courtyard of Buckingham Palace the sun, which until then had been waiting its opportunity
behind the clouds, tried an experimental shine. At a quarter-past eleven precisely, at the very
moment when the first gun of the Royal Salute boomed out in Hyde Park to announce that Her
Majesty herself was leaving the Palace, the experiment developed into an achievement. The light
haze that had hung in the air seemed instantaneously to melt away, and the sunshine burst out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
bright and clear over the jubilant city. It seemed as though the sunshine was one of the prearranged
items of the programme, and had been carried out with the absolute punctuality which
marked the carrying out of all the

St. Paul&rsquo;s; thence by Cheapside, King William Street, London Bridge, the Borough, Westminster
Bridge, Parliament Street, Horse Guards&rsquo; Parade, and the Mall, back to Buckingham Palace.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before leaving Buckingham Palace,
the Queen gave the signal for the
transmission to all parts of the Empire
of that gracious message which is now
engraven on the
hearts of her people.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Queen&rsquo;s Message to her people.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
A private telegraph
wire had been erected between the
Palace and the Central Telegraph Office.
Her Majesty touched a button attached
to a small telegraphic instrument in
connection with this wire, thereby giving
the signal to the officials at the Telegraph
Office; and before the Royal
carriage had passed through the Palace
gates, the royal message was being
flashed along ten thousand thousand miles of wire to the farthest outposts of British civilization.
Characteristic alike of the monarch and of her people were the simple words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetrywide">
&ldquo;FROM &nbsp; MY &nbsp; HEART &nbsp; I &nbsp; THANK &nbsp; MY &nbsp; BELOVED &nbsp; PEOPLE.<br />
&ldquo;MAY &nbsp; GOD &nbsp; BLESS &nbsp; THEM.<br />
<div class="sigright">&ldquo;V. R. and I.&rdquo;</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">Several replies from distant Colonies were found
awaiting Her Majesty when she returned to her
Palace. Thus the witchcraft of science added another
touch of splendour to these unique festivities.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Soon after nine o&rsquo;clock the first part of the
Procession left Buckingham Palace. It consisted
of the Colonial contingent, headed by Field-Marshal
Lord Roberts, V.C., support&shy;ing a Field-Marshal&rsquo;s
bâton on his right thigh, and mounted on a grey
pony. All along the route the gallant soldier was
greeted with mighty cheers, and it was universally
thought that the choice of so popular a
General to command the Colonial troops while
they were in this country
was a singularly felicitous one.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Colonial Procession.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Immediately behind the Field-Marshal rode
the Canadian Hussars, 2nd Canadian Dragoons,
and the Mounted Police&mdash;a magnificent group of
men, who excited universal admiration&mdash;preceding
the carriage of the Premier of Canada, the
Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier. This gentleman
was received with thunders of applause by the
spectators, as were the other Colonial Premiers;
and if anything were needed to convince our
illustrious visitors that the heart of the old
country is warm for her children, their welcome
on this day of days amply fulfilled the need.
Then came the New South Wales Mounted Rifles, the New South Wales Lancers, and the Victorian
Mounted Rifles&mdash;superb horsemen these, and singularly effective-looking in their slouch hats fastened
up at the side and khaki uniforms&mdash;and after
them the carriage in which rode the Premiers
of New South Wales and Victoria. But it is
impossible to give an account of each group.
The actual spectators of the beautiful Colonial
procession could but feast their eyes on each
body of splendid warriors as it passed, and
cherish a vain wish that the pageant might
be repeated again and again until every individual
horseman and foot-soldier had received
a due meed of admiration. Only too quickly
came into view and passed away New Zealand
mounted troops&mdash;among them a few giant
Maoris&mdash;&mdash;Queensland Mounted Rifles, riflemen
from the Cape and South Australian Lancers,
Natal Carabiniers and Umvoti, Natal and
Border Mounted Rifles, and then troops from
the Crown Colonies; Trinidad Mounted Rifles,
and Zaptiehs from Cyprus; &ldquo;upstanding Sikhs,
tiny little Malays and Dyaks; Chinese with a
white basin turned upside down on their heads;
grinning Hausas, so dead black that they shone
like silver in the sun&mdash;white men, yellow men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
brown men, black men, every colour, every continent, every race, every speech&mdash;and all in arms for
the British Empire and the British Queen.&rdquo; After the Cypriotes came a handful of the Rhodesian
Horse, headed by the Hon. Maurice Gifford, carrying one pathetic empty sleeve across his breast&mdash;a
group that evoked
almost frantic cheering.
&ldquo;Up they came, more
and more,&rdquo; says Mr. G.
W. Steevens, in the <i>Daily
Mail</i> of June 23, &ldquo;new
types, new realms at
every couple of yards, an
anthropological museum&mdash;a
living gazetteer of
the British Empire. With
them came their English
officers, whom they obey
and follow like children.
And you began to understand,
as never before,
what the Empire amounts
to. Not only that we
possess all these remote
outlandish places, and
can bring men from
every end of the earth
to join us in honouring our Queen, but also that all these people are working, not simply under
us, but with us that we send out a boy here and a boy there, and the boy takes hold of the
savages of the part he comes to, and teaches them to march and shoot as he tells them, to obey him
and believe in him, and die for him and the Queen. A plain, stupid, uninspired people, they call
us, and yet we are doing this with every kind of savage man there is. And each one of us&mdash;you
and I, and that man in his shirt-sleeves at the corner&mdash;is a working part of this world-shaping force.
How small you must feel in face of the stupendous whole, and yet how great to be a unit in it!&rdquo;</p>

following these came a Naval Gun

Life Guards, Dragoon

<p>As a grand ceremonial figure the Crown Prince, afterwards the
Emperor Frederick of Germany, had attracted more personal notice
in the procession of 1887 than was accorded to any visitor in that
of 1897, but the <i>personnel</i> of the latter function was, in general, far
more distinguished. As regards the procession of carriages, which
followed immediately after the glittering deputation of officers of
the Imperial Service Troops in India, those containing the Royal
children&mdash;Her Majesty&rsquo;s grandchildren and great-grandchildren&mdash;were
most enthusiastically received by the crowd. The gravity
with which the tiny Princes and Princesses acknowledged the
greetings of the spectators occasioned great delight among the
people, and the military salutes of the young Duke of Albany
and Prince Arthur of Connaught, were the signals for fresh
outbursts of applause. The Empress Frederick, the Duchesses
of York, of Teck, of Connaught, and of Albany, the Princesses
Louise and Henry of Battenberg, were each and all cheered and
cheered again. The Princes and other illustrious persons representing
the States of almost every Kingdom and Republic in
the World, who rode in threes close before the Queen&rsquo;s carriage,
made up a group of almost unparalleled interest and importance.
In recognition of his exalted rank as Commander-in-Chief of the
Army, Lord Wolseley, in the uniform and carrying the bâton of
a Field-Marshal, rode immediately in front of the Queen&rsquo;s
carriage.</p>

</div>

<p>To quote again from Mr. G. W. Steevens, who witnessed the Procession from St. Paul&rsquo;s:&mdash;&ldquo;The
eye was filled with splendour, but fresh splendour came crowding in on it. The advancing
pageant shifted and loosened and came up in opener order. But as the mass of colour became
less massive, it became more wonderfully coloured. Here, riding three and three, came a kaleidoscope
of dazzling horsemen&mdash;equerries and aides-de-camp and attachés, ambassadors and Princes,
all the pomp of all the nations of the earth. Scarlet and gold, azure and gold, purple and gold,
emerald and gold, white and gold&mdash;always a changing tumult of colours that seemed to list and gleam
with a light of their own, and always blinding gold. It was enough. No eye could bear more
gorgeousness; no more gorgeousness could be, unless princes are to clothe themselves in rainbows and
the very sun. The prelude was played, and now the great moment was at hand. Already the carriages
were rolling up full of the Queen&rsquo;s kindred, full of her children and children&rsquo;s children. But we hardly
looked at them. Down there, through an avenue of eager faces, through a storm of white waving
handkerchiefs, through roaring volleys of cheers, there was approaching a carriage drawn by eight
cream-coloured horses. The roar surged up the street, keeping pace with the eight horses. The
carriage passed the barrier; it entered the churchyard; it wheeled left and then right; it drew up at
the very steps of the Cathedral; we all leaped up; cheers broke into screams, and enthusiasm swelled
to delirium; the sun, watery till now, shone out suddenly clear and dry, and there&mdash;and there&mdash;</p>

black bonnet, a simple white sunshade,
sitting quite still, with the

You didn&rsquo;t want to look at the

at the bright gowns and the
young faces in the carriages, nor
yet at the stately princes&mdash;though
by now all these were
ranged in a half circle round
her. You couldn&rsquo;t look at anybody

quiet, so very grave, so very
punctual, so unmistakably and every inch a lady and a Queen. Almost pathetic, if you will, that small
black figure in the middle of these shining cavaliers,
this great army, this roaring multitude; but
also very glorious. When the other kings of the
world drive abroad, the escort rides close in at the
wheels of the carriage; the Queen drove through
her people quite plain and open, with just one
soldier at the kerbstone between her and them.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">THE CROWD WAITING FOR THE QUEEN AT LUDGATE CIRCUS.</p>

<p>Her Majesty was visibly moved at the sight of the immense concourse of people
at this point; little Princess Eva of Battenberg on the contrary waved her hand in
delighted acknowledgment of their cheers. In the foreground is the Lord Mayor,
who headed the Procession from Temple Bar to the Mansion House.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But we must go back a little. At the Griffin,
which marks the spot where Temple Bar once
stood, the Lord Mayor (the Right Hon. Sir George
Faudel-Phillips) had arrived about 10.15, bearing
the City Sword of State. While waiting for
the Queen the Lord Mayor was entertained, in
accordance with ancient custom, at Childs&rsquo; Bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just before mid-day,&rdquo; says a writer in the
<i>Times</i> of June 23, &ldquo;a loud roar of cheering announced
the approach of the Queen, and soon the
State carriages drew up at the
Griffin, where the Lord Mayor
and his deputation, on foot,
bareheaded, were awaiting Her Majesty.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Queen&rsquo;s Reception at the City Boundary.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The interesting ceremony of the presentation
of the sword did not occupy a minute.
This handsome sword, in its pearl-covered scabbard,
which has been presented by successive Lord
Mayors at this very spot to many Sovereigns, from
Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time to the present day, was
handed to the Lord Mayor by the City Sword-bearer
with a low obeisance. Sir George Faudel-Phillips
held the hilt towards Her Majesty, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
merely touched it, and ordered him to lead the way into the city. The Lord Mayor with considerable
alacrity hurried to the spot south of the Griffin where he had left his horse, mounted it, and rode off
eastward bareheaded, holding the sword aloft.&rdquo;</p>

immediately behind. In the background are the officers of the Royal household and others. Just in front of the City Griffin the Lord Mayor is seen preparing to
mount his horse, an operation in which the police and some officials exhibit an anxious interest.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>So the magnificent cortège passed on up Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill to St. Paul&rsquo;s. At the
steps of the west front of the great Cathedral was to take place that religious ceremony which was to
be the central point in the great celebration. On either side of the portico was erected a huge stand,
set apart for ambassadors and other officials who had no place in the Procession. The right-hand
stand facing Ludgate Hill was occupied by a splendid company of Indian Rajahs and other Oriental
notabilities. On the steps themselves were 500 choristers, and bands. Soon after the Queen left
Buckingham Palace the Archbishops and other officiating clergy took their stand upon the Cathedral
steps. The Archbishops of York and Canterbury wore purple coronation copes, the Bishop of London
a splendid new yellow cope, the Dean and Chapter copes of green, gold, and white, while the Bishop
of Winchester, as Prelate of the Order of the Garter, wore the dark blue robes of that Order. The
Marquis of Salisbury, the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, and the Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain were
the most noticeable figures in the great assemblage of distinguished laymen collected at this point.</p>

The Old Hundredth was then sung, followed by the National Anthem, the strains being taken up by
the general public all round the Cathedral, and then the Archbishop, acting on a sudden and most
happy impulse, called for three cheers for the Queen. It is not too much to say that Her Majesty
has never been greeted with a more enthusiastic salvo from the throats of her people than she received

<p>Lord Robert Cecil, eldest surviving son of the second
Marquis, was born at Hatfield in 1830, and educated at
Eton and Christchurch, Oxford. M.P. for Stamford,
1853&ndash;1868, when he succeeded to the Marquisate.
Secretary of State for India, 1866&ndash;67, and 1874&ndash;78.
Minister Plenipotentiary at the Constantinople Conference,
1876; Foreign Secretary, 1878&ndash;80. With
Lord Beaconsfield he represented England at the Berlin
Conference in 1878. Leader of the
Conservative Party in the House of Peers
since 1881; Premier 1885&ndash;86, 1886&ndash;1892,
and since 1895.</p>

</div>

<p>It is needless to trace the progress of the Empress-Queen through the districts inhabited by her
poorer, but no less affectionate, people&mdash;from the City to London Bridge, in Southwark, in Lambeth,
and on over Westminster Bridge. Everywhere her reception was the same&mdash;a magnificent outburst
of love and devotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>The stand that had been erected for the Members of Parliament
at Westminster occupied almost the whole space between
the Clock Tower and the river, and was crowded in every corner.
Places had been balloted for and Conservatives and Radicals
were found seated together in the utmost harmony, differences
of political opinion being entirely forgotten in the universal
desire to see the procession, and to do honour to the great lady
who was the centre and cynosure of all. When the Queen&rsquo;s
carriage came in sight the Members rose in one body and cheered
as they had never cheered even their chosen leaders in the House
itself. This assuredly is a testimony to the universal esteem in
which Her Majesty is held by the Nation at large. There were
about 600 Members, representing every shade of political feeling
throughout the three kingdoms, rivalling one another in their
eagerness to display their devotion to the hereditary head of the
State. It is safe to say that no popularly-elected president of
any existing Republic would be greeted in the streets of his capital
by all classes of his fellow-citizens with a tithe of the respect,
admiration, and affection accorded to our constitutional Monarch
on this day of her Jubilee. The Sovereigns of the other European
States&mdash;some of whom are wont to exact loyalty at the point of
the sword&mdash;may well have
envied the happy lot of a
Queen whose chief protection
is her people&rsquo;s love.</p>

<p>More than human must she have been had she been able to pass without emotion through those
millions of loving men and women shouting themselves hoarse in the exuberance of their loyalty.
Sixty years a Queen, with such a celebration
to mark the sixtieth year! Not
when Solomon reigned in all his glory&mdash;not
when the Roman conqueror rode
in triumph along the Appian Way to
receive the plaudits of Imperial Rome&mdash;not
when Napoleon the Great snatched
the Emperor&rsquo;s diadem from the Pope

a single human being been the centre
of so much earthly splendour before.</p>

<p>Some mention should be made of
the presents given to the Queen by her
royal kinsmen and her household. The
Princes and Princesses more nearly related
to the head of the House of
Hanover had prepared a pleasant surprise
in the shape of a copy of Mr. Holmes&rsquo;s
authorised &ldquo;Life of the Queen,&rdquo; bound
in covers of purest gold.

Two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
ounces of gold were used,
and the only ornaments
consisted of the Imperial
monogram
surmounted
by a Crown,
and having at its base a
scroll bearing the legend,
&ldquo;1837: June 20: 1897.&rdquo;
These were composed
of 352 diamonds, with
rubies and emeralds set in
red enamel. On the back
cover were engraved facsimiles
of the signatures
of the various royal subscribers.
A magnificent
brooch of diamonds and
pearls was presented to
Her Majesty by the
Princess of Wales, her
children, the Duchess of
York, and the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Fife. From
her household
the Queen received a
bracelet of beautiful workmanship
composed of round medallions set in brilliants,
with large rubies and sapphires at
intervals. On the medallions were engraved
the rose, shamrock, and thistle, the lotus-flower
representing the Colonies. The Queen
was highly pleased with this token of the
affection of her household, and wore it at all
the State dinners. The design was the work
of H.R.H. Princess Henry of Battenberg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May your life be prolonged, and peace, honour, and prosperity bless the people over whom

<p>The list of Jubilee honours published in the newspapers of
June 22 presented some features of great interest. The most
popular elevations were those of the eleven Colonial Prime Ministers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
to the dignity of Privy Councillors. It was felt that the nucleus of
the long-dreamed-of Pan-Britannic Council had been formed. The
elevation of Mr. W. E. H. Lecky, one of the members for the Dublin
University, to the same dignity was recognised as a graceful compliment
to the world of learning.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Jubilee Honours.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The baronetcy conferred on the Lord Mayor of London was well-deserved,
for no Lord Mayor had done so much in the present century
to enhance the reputation of the Mansion House for philanthropic
enterprise and lavish
hospitality. Two new
Lord Mayoralties, those
of Sheffield and Leeds,
were created; and three
towns, Nottingham,
Bradford, and Kingston-upon-Hull,
were raised
to the importance of
cities. In late years
peerages have generally
been bestowed on men
who have achieved
greatness in the commercial world, and no choice could
have been happier than that of Sir John Burns, Bart.,
the head of the Cunard Steamship Company, while
that conferred on the Right Hon. Sir Donald Smith,
G.C.M.G., was held to be as much a compliment to the
man himself as to the Dominion of Canada, of which he
was High Commissioner.</p>

Odontoglossum Citrosmum. Orchids from Australia, South Africa, New

<p class="alone in0 center">THE RIGHT HON. SIR J. GORDON SPRIGG,</p>

<p class="alone in0 center"><span class="smcap">Premier of Cape Colony.</span></p>

<p>Son of the late Rev. J. Sprigg, of Ipswich;
born in 1830. He worked on the Hansard staff

<p>Generally speaking,
a more ample recognition
of the claims of
the Colonial Empire, as
well as of Art and
Science at home, marked
the Diamond Jubilee
honours list.</p>

<p>It was hoped by
many that advantage
would have been taken
of this unique occasion
to extend the sovereign dignity of the Queen, so that it might include
not only the United Kingdom and India but also the English-speaking
Colonies. The addition of the names of the Colonies to the legend
on the coinage would have followed this step as a natural corollary,
and there can be no doubt it would have found favour with the great
majority of the Queen&rsquo;s subjects at home and abroad. Reasons of
State may have interfered, but they cannot be insuperable, and we
may look forward with confidence to the time when Parliament will
decorate the Queen with this splendid honour.</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="dropleft3">O</span>N the evening of June 22, and for two or three days following, London was ablaze
with illuminations. In the city especially these were on a scale of unparalleled magnificence.
The Bank of England was fringed and
festooned with myriads of many-coloured lamps,
while from the parapet of the corner which looks
towards Cheapside there glowed and scintillated a dazzling fan-shaped
device of huge size. Over the chief entrance appeared
the following inscription in letters of living fire: &ldquo;She Wrought
Her People Lasting Good.&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Illuminations in London.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The pillars of
the Mansion House and the Royal Exchange
were entwined with bands of light, and every
detail of their architecture was accentuated by rows of tiny lamps.
In this, the very heart of London, it was as light as day. It
may be mentioned that 35,000 gas jets were used in decorating
the Mansion House alone.</p>

<p>Moving westward with
the vast throng of well-behaved
sightseers, the
next point of great interest
was the dome of
St. Paul&rsquo;s. It had been
suggested that the Cathedral
should be illuminated,
as were the other important
buildings in the city, but the possibility of danger from
fire acted as a deterrent. Instead of this, powerful electric
search-lights were focussed on the dome and west front with
wonderful effect. The dome stood up clear against the dark
sky, and the stonework supporting and crowning it glowed
like whitest marble. It is said that the expense of this installation
was at the rate of £1,400 a night.</p>

<p>On every side of the route down Ludgate Hill, Fleet Street,
and the Strand, and more westward still, through Pall Mall,
St. James&rsquo;s, and Mayfair, iridescent stars and crowned monograms
glowed like titanic jewels from a thousand buildings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Fleet Street and the Strand were garlanded across with festoons of many-coloured globes, and the
streets of this part of
the town resembled
nothing so much as
an unending triumphal
arch of rainbow-hued
fire. Observed
from Waterloo
Place, Pall Mall
seemed literally ablaze
with general conflagration,
so lavishly were
the Clubs illuminated.
The beautiful floral
arches which crossed
St. James&rsquo;s Street at
every few feet were
beaded with numberless
electric glow-lamps, and these were to have been set alight by the Princess of Wales touching a button
in Marlborough House. But on the previous
day some unexplained defect in
the electric circuit had resulted in the
ignition of a portion of the illuminations,
and it was considered unsafe to
try the experiment again. Marlborough
House had over the entrance gates a
branch of laurel of various natural tints,
interspersed with red berries, forming
one main arch over the gateway, and
two side arches over the doors. The
main laurel arch supported an oval
medallion, surmounted by a crown, and
bore the monogram &ldquo;V.R.I.&rdquo; surrounded
by a garter. The side arches carried a
Prince of Wales&rsquo;s plume and badge.
The whole of this was in cut crystal.
The residence of the Duke of York had
a pretty wreath of white rose and pink
may (the former the emblem of the Royal
House of York, the latter prettily suggestive
of the Duchess&rsquo;s name), with the
monogram, &ldquo;V.R.I.&rdquo; in the centre. This
device was carried out in gas jets.
Piccadilly, Regent Street, and Oxford
Street were not so generally illuminated
as those thoroughfares we have already
mentioned, but individual establishments approached very closely to the high level attained elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that every town
and village in England and Scotland had
its own miniature celebration, its own
procession, its own feast for the poor,
its sports, or its firework display.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Provincial and Colonial Celebrations.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
At Sandringham a service
was held on the hill outside the
church. About 2,000 children from the
various parts of the Prince of Wales&rsquo;
estate had tea in tents in the cricket
ground. In Liverpool the principal
streets were lavishly decorated, and about
midday there was a procession of trades
and friendly societies, in which about
8,000 persons took part. On the river
there was a grand display of mercantile
vessels dressed from stem to stern in
flags. The Corporation of Manchester had generously voted £10,000 towards the Jubilee festivities.
The streets were gaily decorated, and in the morning 100,000 children were entertained at breakfast
and presented with Jubilee medals. In Birmingham there was a great historical procession, and in
the evening displays of fireworks in three of the public parks. Many places commemorated the event
by building new hospitals
or by placing those already
existing on a sound
financial basis. The generosity
of the citizens of
Newcastle-on-Tyne was
such that a fund of
£100,000 was raised for
the purpose of establishing
a new infirmary. In
the city of York the round
of gaieties commenced at
the Mansion House, where
the Lord Mayor and Lady
Mayoress entertained to
breakfast the members of
the Corporation and the
Jubilee Committee. At
noon a thanksgiving service
was held in the
Minster. To the young
people of the city the
occasion was made an
eventful one, for 14,000
of them, along with 1,300
teachers, assembled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
1.15 p.m. at their respective schools, where each was presented with a medal commemorative of
the occasion. At night various points of the city were illuminated; a powerful search-light lit up the
country for miles around, this being fixed on the central tower of the
Cathedral, the west front of which was also illuminated with coloured
fires. All over the country the occasion was made one of real rejoicing
for the poor and needy, public and private enterprise co-operating
to entertain them in the most hospitable manner.</p>

rockets gave the signal to the bonfires
on the neighbouring hills to
make ready, and a few seconds before
10.30 Mrs. Cameron Campbell
of Monzie touched the wire at the
foot of the hill, and on the stroke of
time the huge beacon burst into a
brilliant sheet of flame, and was answered
from hill after hill throughout
Scotland. At the same time the following telegrams were despatched:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Big Ben, Westminster:&mdash;&lsquo;Our Highland hills in blazing
bonfires join with London&rsquo;s illuminations in honour of our Queen.&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;To the Lord Mayor, London:&mdash;&lsquo;O&rsquo;er loch and glen our bonfires
shine to greet with you our Queen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In all two thousand five hundred bonfires that had been erected
on as
many
eminences throughout the United Kingdom
were set alight at about half-past
ten o&rsquo;clock at night, and as the fires
of these great beacons died down there
faded away into history the greatest
day of rejoicing the Anglo-Saxon has
known since the glad news arrived that
the conqueror of Europe had been overthrown
at Waterloo.</p>

<div class="caption"> THE JUBILEE IN HIGH LATITUDES: ELMWOOD, FRANZ JOSEF LAND.

<p>It is characteristic of our nation and our times that at this, the most northerly outpost of
civilized man&mdash;the head-quarters of the Jackson-Harmsworth Polar Expedition&mdash;the Jubilee was
celebrated &ldquo;with all the ardour of Big Englanders.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Colonies were as enthusiastic
as the Old Country in their celebrations
of the Jubilee. In Ottawa there was a
gathering of 7,000 school children on
Parliament Hill. Each of the children
carried a Union Jack, and when these
were waved together, while the National
Anthem was being sung, the effect is described
as having been very remarkable.
At night the Parliament House was ablaze with 10,000 incandescent lamps, an inscription on the
right or Senate wing reading &ldquo;God save the Queen,&rdquo; while on the left or Commons wing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
device read &ldquo;Dieu sauve la Reine.&rdquo; Quebec, Montreal, Toronto, and Winnipeg had each its own
well-arranged festivities. In Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide, and in the cities of New Zealand, the
day was kept as a general holiday, the decorations and illuminations being splendid in every case.
In Cape Town there was a review of troops and a huge procession headed by the Naval Brigade. In
Egypt, at Lagos, Sierra Leone, and at Mauritius, in the far east at Singapore, at Hong Kong,
and at Shanghai, in the East Indies and the West Indies, in British Honduras and British Guiana&mdash;everywhere
where the Union Jack flies Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects gathered together to do her honour.
Save only in her Empire of India, where the hearts of men were hardly in tune with the festive
spirit of the day. Yet, in spite of the recent earthquake, which had shaken Calcutta to its foundations;
in spite of the plague, now happily only lingering in Bombay, and the devastations of the
recent famine, India was not without her joyful celebrations, these appropriately taking the form, for
the most part, of acts of charity and mercy.</p>

<p class="alone in0 center">THE SPEAKER IN HIS STATE COACH BEARING THE COMMONS&rsquo; ADDRESS TO HER MAJESTY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>On Wednesday, June 23, the Lord Chancellor (Lord Halsbury) carried the address of congratulation
of the Upper House to Buckingham Palace, and presented it to the Queen. This address had
been moved in the House of Lords by the Marquis of Salisbury on Monday, June 21, in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Addresses from Lords and Commons.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
&ldquo;That a humble address be presented to Her Majesty on the auspicious completion of the
sixtieth year of her happy reign, and to assure Her Majesty that this House
proudly shares the great joy with which her people celebrate the longest, the
most prosperous, and the most illustrious reign in their history, joining with them
in praying earnestly for the continuance during many years of Her Majesty&rsquo;s life and health.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Speaker Gully, arrayed in his handsome Robes of State, went in his great old gilded State
coach to the Palace with a similar message from the Commons.</p>

<p>The same day the Queen left town for Windsor. A touching ceremony marked the occasion.
At Her Majesty&rsquo;s special request, the stands on Constitution Hill were filled with 10,000 children
from the Board Schools and Voluntary Schools of all denominations. By four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon
the children were in their places, and were regaled with buns, milk, and sweets.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Gathering of School Children.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
At about a quarter to five Her Majesty&mdash;with whom were the Empress Frederick,
Princess Henry of Battenberg, and the Duke of Connaught&mdash;drove up from
Buckingham Palace. The children rose in their places and cheered their Queen to the echo, and
immediately afterwards they sang the National Anthem, the band of the Grenadier Guards leading.
&ldquo;While the voices filled the air with the grand old melody, Her Majesty turned upon the singers a
face radiant with love and happiness. Those who think of Her Majesty as &lsquo;the Queen-mother&rsquo; should
have looked upon her then to have found a realisation of the ideal.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>A State Performance at the Opera was, however, the principal feature in the Jubilee programme
of June 23. With the exception of the Queen herself, almost every Royal personage who had taken
part in the Jubilee Procession of the day before was present, and a special box on the right of the
Royal Box was reserved for the Colonial Prime Ministers and their wives. The house was decorated
from floor to ceiling with roses of every shade&mdash;some 60,000 blossoms being used for this purpose.
Boxes on the grand tier, which had been sold by the management for £50 for the evening, were sold
again at prices ranging up to £150, while the stalls realised £10 at least in every case. Famous as
Covent Garden is for splendid &ldquo;houses,&rdquo; the brilliant assemblage on this evening quite eclipsed all
previous gatherings.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that the whole social world of the country was there. The handsome
uniforms of the men, the beauty, diamonds, and dresses of the ladies, set in a frame of so much floral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
magnificence, made up a scene the splendour of which was never likely to fade from the memory of
anyone who witnessed it. In all that gorgeous company none attracted as much admiration as the
Princess of Wales. Simply dressed in white satin, with the red sash of some Order across her shoulders,
and wearing a crown of diamonds, Her Royal Highness was, by universal consent, the queen of beauty
in a house full of the most beautiful women in the three kingdoms.</p>

<p>It was only to have been expected, perhaps, that the most generally-approved Jubilee celebration
should have been inaugurated by the same most charming Princess. This was nothing less than
the entertaining at dinner of 300,000 of the London poor. The feast took place in different large
buildings all over the poorer parts of the Metropolis. The Princess, accompanied by His Royal
Highness and the Princesses Victoria of Wales and Charles of Denmark, drove round and was personally
present at as many as possible of the dining halls. At the People&rsquo;s Palace, in the Mile End
Road, where 1,600 crippled children feasted, Her Royal Highness went in and out among the children,
bestowing here and there a smile, and here and there a few words of kindly encouragement.</p>

A State Reception at Buckingham Palace, where Her Majesty was represented

<p>Friday, the 25th, was marked by an afternoon performance of &ldquo;The Bells&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Story of
Waterloo&rdquo; at the Lyceum Theatre, to which the men of the Colonial Contingent had been kindly
invited by Sir Henry Irving.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Special Performance at the Lyceum.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Sir Henry was uproariously cheered on his first
appearance and at every interval during the afternoon, and after the splendid
presentation of &ldquo;The Bells&rdquo; he was called again and again before the curtain, and
finally compelled to make a speech. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen&mdash;I will say my dear comrades&mdash;for your greeting to-day proves that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>are comrades, one and all&mdash;I cannot tell you how great a delight and pleasure it has been to us to
have the honour, the privilege, and the pride of making you welcome here to-day, and I hope&mdash;I can
but hope&mdash;that centuries hence our children will hold very dear to them the spirit which gives us the
opportunity of meeting you; that spirit of love for our Queen and our country&mdash;that great nation
which you typify&mdash;which is the strength and glory and power of it; and of that sweet and gracious
lady, that beloved Queen of ours, for whom your swords will flash and our hearts will pray. I thank
you with all my heart and
soul for your welcome, and
I thank you on behalf of
one and all behind this
curtain, and we send our
most cordial greeting to
one and all in front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eton College has always
enjoyed the favour of
royalty, and on the evening
of Saturday, June 26,
the boys furnished one of
the most picturesque celebrations
of Jubilee time.
In the morning the Queen
had entertained, in the
Home Park at Windsor,
five or six thousand children.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Torchlight Evolutions by Etonians.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
After that a
grand review of firemen
from all parts of the
country took place. At ten
o&rsquo;clock in the evening the
Queen took up her place in
a window in the east corridor,
and the Eton boys
filed into the Quadrangle
(many of them in the uniform
of their Volunteer
Corps) each boy carrying
a torch or a lantern. A
beautiful effect was produced
when the boys went
through a variety of intricate
evolutions.</p>

</div>

<p>All this time the Naval
Review at Spithead had
been a-preparing. Every
nation that boasts a Navy
had sent a ship, and the streets of Portsmouth were filled with our own bluejackets and those belonging
to the foreign ships.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Naval Review.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
All the World had come to see for herself what the
British Fleet was like, and we were able to provide such a Naval spectacle as has
never been witnessed before. Just as on June 22 we had furnished forth an Imperial pageant demonstrating
the scope and strength of our dominion over the land surface of the globe, so now, on Saturday,
June 26, we showed that our sovereignty over the seas is as far reaching and even more absolute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Without taking one single vessel from the Mediterranean, from the Chinese Seas, from Australia, India,
or North America, we displayed at Spithead such a congregation of ships of war as filled with
amazement and despair those representatives
of alien Powers who knew our sea-going
prowess only by repute. In all
about 165 ships of our Navy rode at
ease, in four long lines and two short
ones in the narrow Strait, and they were
manned by 40,000 officers and men.
The length of the lines of British ships
aggregated nearly thirty miles! The
Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Sir Nowell
Salmon, G.C.B., V.C., flew his flag on
the <i>Renown</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Painful, indeed, must have been the
reflections of those strangely-constituted
Britons&mdash;if any were present&mdash;whose interest
in public affairs is limited to the
squalid area of parochial politics, as their
eyes ranged over the water in the direction
of this mighty fleet. With what
vain regret must such as these have
looked back on the days, some ten or a
dozen years since, when British Naval supremacy was but a name&mdash;when we had few ships, and
those out of date, and few men to man them. Alas! for the fond anticipations of those who were
looking forward to the time when Britain should throw away her Empire and sink to the prosperous
unimportance of a Belgium, the cheerful mediocrity of a Holland. There, at Spithead, was overwhelming
proof that such views are not shared by the great bulk of British people, whether Liberals,
Radicals, or Conservatives; that
power is still sweet to the ruling
race; that that Empire which
has been bought with the blood
of the Anglo-Saxon will be maintained
in its integrity at any cost.
Here they lay in serried ranks
on the moving waters, orderly as
soldiers on a parade ground&mdash;the
steel-clad champions of a nation&rsquo;s
honour&mdash;as powerful to compel
peace as to put the issue of war
out of question if war must come.</p>

<p>Exactly at eight o&rsquo;clock the
combined fleet began to decorate
itself with a million flags, taking
time from the Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s
flagship. The unnumbered
merchant and pleasure
craft of all kinds that dotted the
waters and lay still at moorings
by the quays were already gay with streaming pennants, nor were the fourteen battleships of the foreign
powers behindhand in embellishing themselves for the great review. Some time before two o&rsquo;clock
the business of clearing the lines for the procession commenced, and at two precisely a Royal salute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
of guns on shore announced that the Royal yacht was under way. Not long afterwards the <i>Victoria
and Albert</i>, with the Prince of Wales on board, preceded by the Trinity House yacht <i>Irene</i>, approached
the head of the lines. Royal salutes and the cheers of bluejackets
marked the passage of the Royal yacht along and through the lines.
The <i>Victoria and Albert</i> was followed by a train of vessels&mdash;the Peninsular
and Oriental Company&rsquo;s liner, the <i>Carthage</i>, carrying those Royal
guests for whom there was no accommodation on the <i>Victoria and
Albert</i>; then another Royal yacht, the <i>Alberta</i>; then the <i>Enchantress</i>,
with the Lords of the Admiralty and their friends; next the <i>Danube</i>,
carrying the members of the House of Lords; after her the <i>Wildfire</i>,
with the Colonial Prime Ministers and their suites and the Right Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, on board;
then again the superb Cunard liner, the <i>Campania</i>, carrying the House
of Commons; and lastly the <i>Eldorado</i>, with the foreign Ambassadors.
The procession occupied two hours in traversing the lines. Before the
proceedings terminated the <i>Victoria and Albert</i> anchored abreast of the
flagship <i>Renown</i> and the Prince of Wales received all flag officers,
British and foreign, on board, After this ceremony the Royal yacht
weighed anchor and returned to Portsmouth, receiving, as she departed,
three cheers from every ship in the fleet. Simultaneously
with the arrival of the Prince of Wales in Portsmouth Harbour the
following
signal
was
made to
the fleet
by Admiral
Sir Nowell Salmon:&mdash;&ldquo;I am commanded
by the Prince of Wales, as representing
the Queen, to express his entire satisfaction
with the magnificent naval display at
Spithead and the perfect manner in which
all the arrangements were carried out, and
at his request I order the main-brace to
be spliced.&rdquo; Splicing the main-brace, it
should be explained, involves the serving
out of an extra allowance of grog, and is
still a very popular order with our man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s men. Almost immediately after this a thunderstorm burst,
accompanied by a deluge of rain, and for some hours the &ldquo;city of ships&rdquo; was lost in an impenetrable haze.</p>

It was not destined,
however, that the hundreds
of thousands of
spectators who were afloat
in the pleasure
boats and who lined
Southsea beach and the
shores of the Isle of
Wight overlooking Spithead,
were to lose the
most beautiful spectacle
of all. As daylight faded
so faded the storm, and
at a quarter-past nine
o&rsquo;clock, when the signal
for lighting up the ships
was given by a single
gun, the conditions for
viewing the illuminations
were as perfect as
possible. To quote again
a writer, Mr. G. W.
Steevens, to whom we
are already much indebted:&mdash;&ldquo;The
thunderstorm
was only an episode.
Having done its
business, it went dutifully
away, and left the
field clear for the illuminations.
Out on the sea
front you could see the
lights of the fleet like
glow-worms in the dark.
Then suddenly there
sounded a gun; and as
I moved along Southsea
Common there appeared
in the line a ship of fire.
A ship all made of fire&mdash;hull
and funnels and
military masts with fighting
tops. And then
another, and another,
and another. The fleet
revealed itself from behind
the castle, ship
after ship traced in fire
against the blackness.
From the head of Southsea
they still came on&mdash;fresh
wonders of grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
and light and splendour, stretching away, still endlessly as in the daytime, till they became a confused
glimmer six miles away. It was the fleet and yet not the fleet. You could recognise almost any ship by
her lines and rig&mdash;just as if it had been in day,
only transmuted from steel and paint into living

bunting, but pure colour. The heavy hard
fleet vanished, and there came out in its stead
a picture of it magically painted in pure light.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The Naval Review of 1897 was over. It had provided a sublime spectacle for our Colonial and
foreign visitors, and it had taught a lesson that was meant to be learned by the whole World, and was
actually so learned. A
great military Power we
might not be, but on the
seas our dominion was,
and must ever be, unquestionable.
The chorus
of admiration that arose
from the Continental and
American press showed
that the necessity for this
pre-eminence was recognised
and allowed. If we
had not known it long
ourselves, our foreign
critics, both friendly and
hostile, had been aware
that a great navy was
the paramount condition
of our national existence.</p>

<p>A circumstance that
concerned the gallant men
of the Colonial contingent
who had taken part in the Jubilee Procession must here be touched on.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Colonial Troops at the Naval Review.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Strange as it may seem,
there had been originally no provision made for the representation at the Naval
Review of the Colonial contingent. This remissness on the part of the authorities
occasioned a good deal of surprise, which found its expression in the columns of
the London <i>Daily Mail</i>; but it was not until the newspaper in question took the matter up in right
good earnest that the authorities bestirred themselves. It was then proposed to charter a vessel and
send the Colonials down
to Portsmouth some two
or three days after the
Review&mdash;it being somewhat
artlessly explained
that as the fleet would
still be in position and
the Review well over,
our visitors would enjoy
a better opportunity of
examining the ships in
detail! Needless to say
this line of argument
found little favour with
the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the <i>Globe</i>, and the other newspapers which were now strenuously advocating the claims
of our visitors. They raised their voices once more, with the result that at the eleventh hour the
responsible officials announced that the difficulties&mdash;whatever they were&mdash;had been surmounted, and
that the Colonial contingent were to see the Imperial fleet on the actual day of Review in all its
majesty and splendour. The fleet was again dressed and illuminated on the following Monday&mdash;Coronation
Day. Mention should be made of a little vessel, first seen at the Review, which marks a new
departure in marine engineering. This is the <i>Turbinia</i> torpedo-boat, driven by steam turbines at
2,100 revolutions, accomplishing 32 or 33 knots per hour.</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="dropleft3">O</span>N the Monday after the Review the Queen returned from Windsor to the Metropolis.
She was received everywhere with enthusiastic greetings of loyalty and affection. It
was no mere conventional reception this. The Nation had realised lately, as never
before, the part their Queen had played in the building of the Empire, and one and
all flocked out to do her honour. Her Majesty had returned to London to attend
the garden party which was to be held in the grounds of Buckingham Palace in the afternoon. On
her way from Paddington Station she visited Kensington, the place of her birth.</p>

<p>In front of St. Mary Abbott&rsquo;s Church, Kensington High Street, the Queen stopped and
received a splendid bouquet of roses at the hands of the Princess Louise.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Queen&rsquo;s Visit to Kensington.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Then the Marquis of
Lorne presented the Chairman of the Vestry, who handed Her Majesty a
loyal address, in which Kensington recalled with pride its long and many Royal
associations. The Queen&rsquo;s reply was characteristic and particularly interesting
in view of recent events:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your loyal and kind address. It gives me great pleasure to receive the assurance
of devotion and goodwill from the inhabitants of Kensington, and I gladly renew my associations with
a place which, as the scene of my birth and of my summons to the throne, has ever had, and will ever
have, with me solemn and tender recollections.&rdquo; The Queen then drove on to the Palace, 10,000
school children singing the National Anthem as she passed through Kensington Gardens.</p>

<p>The subsequent garden party in the gardens of Buckingham Palace was one of the most brilliant
functions on record. The weather
was beautifully fine, and there
was a unique attendance of Royal
and other
guests; the
Colonial Premiers
were present, and the whole
of the special envoys of Foreign
Powers and other distinguished
Jubilee guests.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Garden Party at Buckingham Palace.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The grounds were
opened at four o&rsquo;clock, and in a
very short time the dresses of
the ladies and the brilliant uniforms
of men transformed them
into a moving blaze of colour.
Her Majesty&rsquo;s guests amused
themselves in a variety of ways&mdash;a
favourite form of diversion
being a row on the Palace lake,
on which were a large number
of boats in charge of picturesquely-attired
Queen&rsquo;s watermen.</p>

<p>When Her Majesty had traversed the lawn, and Lord Lathom had pointed many of the people out to
her, she moved to the entrance of her own tent, and sat sipping tea and eating strawberries, with a white
apron&mdash;the strings of which passed over her shoulders&mdash;spread on her lap in the homeliest fashion.</p>

<p>The Naval Review had been an exhibition of our first line of defence, and though there was
nothing in the nature of boastfulness or arrogance about it, it was such a demonstration as could have
been made by no other
Power&mdash;perhaps, by no
two Foreign Powers in combination.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Review at Aldershot.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Military Review at Aldershot on July 1
was, of course, a much
more modest affair, but
the quality of the troops
employed imparted a distinction
to the function
which went far to compensate
for their smallness
in numbers. Judged by
Continental standards our
Army is insignificant in
size, but it must always
command respect. Its
traditions are splendid,
and its recent achievements
completely satisfactory.
Some of the
foreign Princes who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
present with the Queen at Aldershot on July 1 had seen ten times as many soldiers in review, but it
is safe to say that not one of them had ever seen a finer body, man for man, than the 28,000 British
troops gathered together on Laffan&rsquo;s Plain. The presence among these of detachments from so
many British Colonies
added a significance to
the proceedings that
could not have been
paralleled at a Military
Review anywhere else
in the World.</p>

<p>About a quarter-past
four o&rsquo;clock the
Queen drove up in a
carriage. The troops
were arranged in the
shape of three sides of
a great rectangle, Her
Majesty occupying the
centre of the vacant side.
A Royal Salute was
given, and then commenced
the march past.
The honour of marching
in the van had been
assigned very properly
to the Colonial troops,
consisting of 434 cavalry,
184 artillery and engineers,
and 423 infantry.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The troops which followed represented almost every branch of the regular army and made a
splendid show. But here, as in the Jubilee Procession itself, the Colonial contingent attracted the
greatest share of attention. To see gallant horsemen and steady marching infantry in picturesque
unfamiliar uniforms from every Continent all following the same flag and serving the same Queen
was to receive a new and inspiring impression of the Empire. The red spaces on the map of the
earth&rsquo;s surface we had known from childhood&rsquo;s day to represent portions of our own Empire&mdash;but
the impression was a vague one until we saw
Canadian, Australian, and South African, actually
under arms in defence of their and our Queen,
as much as of their own distant homes. It was
then brought home to us, with startling effect,
how great is the birthright of every Briton, how
great the privileges attaching to such citizenship&mdash;and
how great the responsibilities. These
men came to us, not in gratitude for any priceless
advantages we have bestowed upon them&mdash;for
we have done nothing of the kind&mdash;but
simply because their blood is the same as ours,
their traditions the same, and their sympathies.
We are still well able to take care of ourselves;
but who shall say that the Old Country may not
one day need the strong, right arms of her children
across the seas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
That our Colonial troops are not merely ornamental soldiers their shooting at Bisley, at the
meeting which ended on July 10, amply proved, if their splendid horsemanship and marching
had not proved it before. Though for the most part entirely unused to the new Lee-Metford rifle,
they secured the Kolapore Cup, and, in a year which produced record scores, held their own
against the picked marksmen of our Regulars and Volunteer Army.</p>

<p>The Review was brought to an end with the defiling past of the infantry. A splendid effect
was produced when the infantry gave the Royal salute, and then burst with one accord into shouts of
cheering&mdash;bonnets and busbies being thrown up into the air or waved frantically on bayonet points.
The Queen returned to Windsor the same evening, and the Jubilee celebrations proper were over.</p>

</div>

<p>On Saturday, July 10, a dinner was given at the St. George&rsquo;s Club, Hanover Square, in honour
of the Colonial Premiers, five of whom were present. A distinguished company assembled; but the
occasion would not have merited mention in a history of the Queen&rsquo;s reign, had it
not been for a speech made by the Right Hon. G. J. Goschen, First Lord of the Admiralty.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>Gift of a Battleship.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In language, the very simplicity of which riveted attention from the first&mdash;coming as it
did from the most eloquent member of Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s Cabinet&mdash;Mr. Goschen announced that he
had that day received a battleship from Sir J. Gordon Sprigg, representing the Government of Cape
Colony! His actual words were:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day I have had an interesting scene, a simple scene, but one which will come home to all of
you. I received the present of an ironclad at the hands of a British Colony. (Loud cheers.) There
was no ceremonial, there was no great reception, there was no blare of trumpets; but Sir Gordon Sprigg
simply came to the First Lord of the Admiralty and told him that the Cape Colony was prepared to
place an ironclad of the first-class at the disposal of the Empire. (Cheers.) I thank him on behalf of
the English nation, I thank him on behalf of the Government, and I thank him also on behalf of
the Empire at large, of which the Cape Colony is so distinguished a part. That offer of a first-class
battleship is accompanied by no conditions; but it is proposed that that ship shall take its place side
by side with those sister ships, paid for by the British taxpayer, which many of you have seen at
Spithead. (Hear, hear.) No conditions attach to it; it is a free gift intended to add to the power of
the British Empire.&rdquo; (Cheers.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
This statement evoked expressions of great enthusiasm from the gentlemen who dined at the
St. George&rsquo;s Club that night; the next morning it thrilled the entire nation. The zenith of the Jubilee
celebrations of 1897 was reached; a self-governing Colony had come forward and presented to the
Crown the most magnificent gift of which history has any record! Jewels and gold and the richest
products of Oriental looms have been showered on our Empress-Queen until her palaces have become
museums of priceless offerings; but that of the Government and people of Cape Colony outvalued
these as much as they outvalue the treasures of ordinary men. Not so much the gift itself, however,
but the spirit of the givers touched the heart of the British people. Not in their most visionary
dreams had Imperialists contemplated such a consummation as this. Sentiment, so often and so
thoughtlessly derided, had triumphed over the cold calculations of the &ldquo;practical&rdquo; politician, and
the foundation-stone of a united Anglo-Saxon Empire had been laid.</p>

<p>There are a few other features of the Jubilee celebrations which demand notice before this narrative
is brought to a close. Chief among these is the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s scheme for establishing the
London hospitals on a firm financial basis&mdash;the greatest charitable project in a year made memorable
by many such undertakings. So far back as February 6, when a thousand Jubilee plans were being
discussed, a statement of the Prince&rsquo;s own wishes in the matter had appeared in the newspapers.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Prince of Wales&rsquo;s Hospital Fund.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
His Royal Highness began by saying that the Queen herself had no wish to express
an opinion as to the form any celebrations might take. In the absence of any
declaration on the part of Her Majesty, His Royal Highness felt at liberty to lay
before the inhabitants of London a scheme very dear to his heart. Briefly explained, they were that
such a sum of money should be secured, in the form preferably of annual donations, as should suffice
to free the London hospitals of debt for ever. An additional annual income of from £100,000 to
£150,000 was necessary.</p>

<p>At the time of sending these pages to press, it is not known how far His Royal Highness&rsquo;s
wishes have been realised; but it is stated that a sufficient amount has been collected to relieve the hospitals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
permanently of some of their more pressing needs.
A device, characteristic of the age, was resorted to to
swell the proceeds of the fund. Two Hospital Stamps
were issued under authority, and sold at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and
1<i>s.</i> each, the more expensive one being of a red colour
and the less expensive blue. An artistic group representing
Charity, after Sir Joshua Reynolds, occupies
the centre of each stamp. The legend &ldquo;1837: The
Queen&rsquo;s Commemoration, 1897&rdquo; runs along the
top, and at the bottom appear the words, &ldquo;Prince
of Wales&rsquo;s Hospital Fund, Albert Edward, Prince,&rdquo;
the signature being a facsimile of His Royal Highness&rsquo;s
handwriting. The sale of these must have been
prodigious, but until the Hospital Fund&rsquo;s accounts are
made up it will be impossible to judge how far philatelists
all over the
world availed themselves
of the opportunity
to add these
unique specimens to
their collections. The
dies from which the Hospital Stamps were printed were subsequently
destroyed in the presence of the Duke of York at the Bank of England.
Another happy idea was the publication of an official programme,
authorised by the Prince of Wales, of the Jubilee Procession. The
programme, which was sold at a shilling a copy, was admirably illustrated.
The entire profits were devoted
to the Hospital Fund.</p>

<p>The commemoration medals
struck to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee
were eagerly bought up by
all classes of Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.
They were, perhaps, the most
artistic things ever issued from the
Royal Mint, though the small size of
some of them interfered sadly with
the effect of the design.
<span class="sidenote"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Jubilee Medals.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The prices
were as follows:&mdash;Large gold, £13; small gold, £2; large silver, 10<i>s.</i>;
small silver, 1<i>s.</i>; and large bronze, 4<i>s.</i> It was a happy idea to give
on the reverse of the medals the Queen&rsquo;s head, by W. Wyon, as it
appeared on the coinage for 1837 to 1887. The choice of the motto&mdash;&ldquo;Longitudo
dierum in dextera ejus et in sinistra gloria&rdquo;&mdash;could not
have been bettered if the whole of literature had been searched
through. The head, by Brock, on the obverse, first used in 1892, is
undoubtedly the most satisfactory likeness of the Queen that has
appeared on the coinage. In the gold medals the metal was unpolished,
and the large silver ones were covered with a thin coating
of platinum, the burnished appearance of newly-stamped coinage being
thus avoided, much to the advantage of the design. In both cases
the metal was of the purest quality, and it is interesting to note that
there was actually £12 15<i>s.</i> worth of gold in the £13 medal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>Innumerable publications relating to the Jubilee were issued from the Press. The <i>Illustrated London

<p>Reviewing the Jubilee celebrations as a whole it is
impossible not to be struck by the leading characteristic
of them all&mdash;their complete success. The Sovereign Lady
in whose honour everything was done, was delighted with
all; her subjects throughout the Empire enjoyed themselves
hugely; not a single accident dimmed the happiness
of Jubilee Day in London; the Procession was the most
splendid ever witnessed; the Review at Spithead transcended
in magnificence anything of the kind recorded in
the annals of our navy; and the Review at Aldershot was
a triumph for our brave little army. Almost as remarkable
was the exaltation of national sentiment manifested
at this time. It seemed as if
we had suddenly discovered that
we belonged to a very great
Empire, and were overjoyed at
the thought of it. When we saw
the Colonial Premiers and the
Colonial soldiers, we realized for
the first time that we were co-heirs
with them to a hundred Empires,
and our imaginations were kindled.
Our political views widened out to
the furthest horizon and we were
Conservatives and Liberals no
longer, but Imperialists. We
wanted but a sign from the Colonies
themselves to declare ourselves Imperialists for ever, and we received a hundred signs. The
offer of a battleship from the Cape Colony was the greatest of these signs, but it was only one
of many. The Colonial Prime Ministers came to us bearing messages of affection from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
great new Britains they represented, and in one or two instances their proposals shadowed forth
measures of great advantage to us and to them. Canada, in particular, offered a considerable reduction
of the tariff in return for the reception of
Canadian goods on terms which have hitherto
been rendered impossible by the existence of
commercial treaties between this country and
Germany and Belgium. She asked, in fact,
for liberty to trade with this country on
terms specially advantageous to both ourselves
and Canada; and in promptly giving
notice to terminate the treaties referred
to, Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s Government accorded
to Canada the honour of taking the first
practical step towards solving the fiscal difficulties
which stand in the way of Imperial
federation. The exhortation of the great
bard who represents so strongly the spirit of
the Victorian age seemed now for the first
time to have come right home to the heart
of the nation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">&ldquo;Sons, be welded each and all,</div>
<div class="line">Into one imperial whole;</div>
<div class="line">One with Britain, heart and soul!</div>
<div class="line">One Life, one Flag, one Fleet, one Throne.&rdquo;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is well that this first great reunion of the Anglo-Saxon race should have taken place on
the occasion of the Queen&rsquo;s Diamond Jubilee Commemoration. Let us hope that she may live to
see another and even greater Jubilee, another gathering together of the scattered members of her
Empire!</p>

first applied to them by Wilson Croker in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for January 1830, wherein
he mentions his attachment to &ldquo;what is called the Tory, but which might, with
more propriety, be called the Conservative Party.&rdquo; The Charter of Conservatism was
never more clearly defined than by Sir Robert Peel, who, speaking at Merchant Taylors&rsquo;
Hall in 1838, said: &ldquo;My object for some years past has been to lay the foundations
of a great party which, existing in the House of Commons, and deriving its strength
from the popular will, should diminish the risk and deaden the shock of collisions
between the two branches of the legislature.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected.</p>

<p>Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Some illustrations have been repositioned and some that originally
overlapped each other are presented separately here. Missing corners
were missing in the source.</p>

<p>Identifying names in some captions have been replaced by letter keys
and corresponding explanations; when the original book used numeric keys,
they have been retained.</p>
<p>Sidenotes appear approximately where they occurred in the source. Depending
on the display device, they may be shown in boldface, slightly smaller
than the main text, with a shaded background; and may appear at the
left margin or mid-line.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been moved to the end of this eBook.</p>

<p>The Index only covers pages 1-192. In the original book, it appeared
immediately after the Preface, but has been moved to the end of this
eBook.</p>

<p>In the original book, the Errata section appeared immediately after the
Index, and has been moved, with the Index, to the end of this eBook.</p>

<p>Index entry for &ldquo;Press, the&rdquo; refers to non-existent page 910. Changed here to &lsquo;190&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_180">181</a>: in illustration caption, &ldquo;Victoria Melitia&rdquo; should be
&ldquo;Victoria Melita,&rdquo; as it is in the illustration caption on page <a href="#Page_176">175</a>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_213">213</a>: The number &ldquo;6&rdquo; in &ldquo;about 600 Members&rdquo; was printed poorly in the source.</p>
